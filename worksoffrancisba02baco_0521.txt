BookII. OF LEARNING.

ΤΗ Ε ἀοᾶϊίηο touehing the platform or nature of good considereth it ei—
ther simple οι· compared, either the kinds of good or 'the degrees of good5
in the later whereof those infinite disputations which were tonching the
supreme degree thei-cof, which they term felicity‚ beatitude‚ or the highest
good, the dofti·ines conccrning which, were as the heathen divinity, are by
the christian faith dischargcd. And, as Aristotle saith, “ That young men
“ may be happy, but not otherwise but by hopc;” so we must all acknow-
ledgc our minority, and embrace the fclicity which is by hope of the future
world.

FREED therefore, and delivered from this doctrine of the philosophers
heaven, whercby they feigned an higher elevation of inan's nature than was
(for we see in what an heighth of style Seneca writeth, Vere magnum, habere
fragilitatem hominis, firmitatem (Ded) we may with more sobriety and
truth receive the rest of their inquiries and labours, wherein for the nature of
good, positive or simple, they have set it down excellently, in describit-lg the
forms of virtue and duty with their situations and postures, in distributing
them into their kinds, parm, provinces, afflons, and administrationS, and
· thelike: nay sarther, they have commended them to man's nature and
spirit, with great quickness of argument and beauty of pei-simibus, yea,
and fortified and entrcnched them (aa much as difeourse can do) against cor-
rupt ancl popular opinions. Again, for the degrees and comparative nature
of good, they have also excellently handlcd it in their triplicity of good,
in the eomparison between a contemplative and an aetive life, in the distinc-
‘tion between virtue with reluCtation, and virtue securcd, in their encoun-
‘ters between honesty and profit, in their balancing of virtue with virtue,
and the like, so as this part deserveth to bc reported for excellently
laboured.

N o Tw 1 T Hs TA N D 1N G, if before they had come to the popular and re—
ceived notions of virtue and vice, pleasure and pain, and the rest, they had
stayed a little longer upon the inquiry concerning the roots of good and evil,
and the strings of those roots, they had given in my opinion a great light to
that Which followed; and specially if they had consulted with nature, they
had made their doctrines less prolix and more profonncl, which being by them
>in part omitted and in part handled with much confufion‚ we will endeavour
to resume and open in a more clear manner.

THERE is formed in every thing a double nature of good, the one as
every thing is a total or substantive in itfelf‚ the other as it is a part or
member of a greater body ,- whereof the later is in degree the greater and
the worthier, because it tendeth to the conservation of a more general form:
therefore wc see the iton in particular sympathy moveth to the loadstone,
but yet if it exceed a certain quantity, it forsaketh the affee‘tion to the load-
stone, and like a good patriot moveth to the earth, which is the region and
country of massy bodies; so may we go forward and see that water and mass y
bodies move to the center of the carth, but rather than to suffer a divulsion
in the continuance of nature they will move upwards from the eentre of
the earth, forsaking their duty to the earth in regard of their duty to the
world. This double nature of good and the comparative thereof is much
more engraven upon man, if he degenerare not, unto whom the conservation
of duty to the publick ought to be much more precious than the conserva-
tion of life and being3 according to that memorable speech of ‘Pompeius
Magnus, when being in commission of purveyance fora famine at Rome, and
being diffuaded with great vehemence and instance by his friends about hilm,
