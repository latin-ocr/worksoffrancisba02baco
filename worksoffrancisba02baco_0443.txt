one corner, you darken the rest: so that the fable and fiction of Scylla,
se eth to be a lively image of this kind of philosophy or knowledge,
w ‘ch was transformcd into a eomely virgin for the upper parts; burthen,

ida fitccinHam, latrantibus inguina monstris: sothe generalities of the
seh ⁴ -men are for a while good and proportionable; but then when you
descend into their distinffions and decisionS, instead of a fruitful womb, for
the use and henefit of man’s life, they end in monstrous altercations, and
barking questions. So as it is not possible but this quality of knowledge
must fall under popular contempt, the people being apt to eontemn truth
upon occasion of controversies and altercationS‚ and to think they are all

out of their way which never meets and when they see such digladia-
tions about subtilties, and matters of no use or moment, they easily fall

, upon that iudgment of ‘Dionjfius of S yraczfize, Verba istafimtfi‘num otiosb—

rum.

N orwirnsraNmNG certain it is, that if those school-men, to their
great thirst of truth and unwearicd travel of wit, had joined variety and
universality of reading and contemplation, they had proved excellent light5‚

, 10 the great advancement of all learning and knowledge3 but as they are, they

are great undertakers indeed, and fierce with dark keeping But as in the
inquiry of the divine truth, their pride inclined to leave the oracle of God's
word, and to vanish in the mixture of their own inventions: so in the in-
quisition of nature, they ever left the oracle of God's works, and adored
the deceiving and deformed images, which the unequal mirror of their
own minds, or a few received authors or principles did represent unto them.
And thus much for the second disease of learning.

Fon the third vice or disease of learning, which concerneth deceit or
untruth, itis of all the rest the foulcst3 as that which doth destroy the es-
senti-al form of knowledge3 which is nothing but a representation of truth;
for thc truth of being, and the truth of knowing are one, differing no more

“ than the direct bearn, and the beam reflected. This vice therefore branch-

cth it self into two sortss delight in deceiving, and aptness to be deceived;
imposture and credulity3 which although they appear to be of a divers na-
ture, the one seeming, to proceed of cunning, and the other of simpli-
city; yet certainly they do for the most part concur: f0r as the verse no-
teth,

Percontatoremfitgito, nam garrulus idem est:

An inquisitive man is a pratler: so upon the like reason, a eredulous
man is a deceiver: as we see 11 111 fame, that he that will easily believe ru-
mours, will as easily augment rumours, and add somewhat rothem of his
own3 which Tacitus wisely noteth, when he saith, Finguntfimul credunt-
φας so great an affinity hath fiffion and belief.

'rius facility of credit, and accepting or admiring things weakly autho·
rized or wari-anteri, is of two kinds, according to the subjedz for it is ei-
ther a belief of history, (or, as the lawyers speak, matter of fast) or else of
matter of art and opinion: as to the former, we see the experienee and in-
convenience of this error in eeclesiastical history, which hath too easily re-
ceived and registred reports and narrations of miracles wrought by martyrs,
hermits, or monks of the desart‚ and other holy men3 and their relicks,
stit-ines, chapels, and images: Which though they had a passage for time,
by the ignorance of the people, the superstitious simplicity of some,
and the politiek toleration of others, holding them but as divine poesies:
