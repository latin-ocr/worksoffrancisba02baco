ther it be art or accident? And therefore many times the impostor is pri-
zed, and the man of virtue taxed. Nay, w'e see the weakness :ind credu·
lity of men is such, as they will often prefer a mountebank or witch before
a learned physseian. And therefore the poets were clear-sighted in dis-
cerning this extreme f011y‚ when they made AEsculapt'ns and Circe bro-
ther and sister, both children of the sun, as in the versess AEn. vii. 772.

IPfi' repertorem medicinae talis v&⁰ artis, ,
Fulmine Phoebigenam stygias detra it ad undas:

And again,
‘Dives inacccffos ubi solis filia lucos, &a AEn. vii. 11.

For in all times, in the opinion of the multitude, witches and old women
and impostor-s, have had a competition with phyficians. And what follow-
eth? Evcn this, that phyficians say to themselves, as Salomon express'eth ir
upon an higher occafion3 If it hefalto me, as befalleth to the fools‚ why
should I labour to be more wife? And therefore Icannot much blame phy-
ficians, that they use commonly to intend some other art or pmftic'e,
which they fancy more than their professIOn. For you {hall have of them,
aiitiqtiarie3‚ poem, humanists, statesmen‚ merchants, divines, andin every of
these better seen than in their profeffion3 and no doubt, upon this ground, thar
they find that mediocrity and excellency in their art, makcth no difference
in profit or reputation towards their fortune: for the weakness of patients,
:ind sweetness of life, and nature of hope, makcth men dcpend upon phy-
ficians with all their defects. But nevertheless‚ these things which we have
spoken of, are courses begotten between a little occasion, and a great deal
ofssoth and default3 for if we will excite and awake our observation, we
{hall see in familiar instances, what a predominant faculty, the subtilty of
spirit hath over the variety of matter or form: nothing more variable than
faces and countenances‚ yet men can bear in memory the infinite distinc-
tions of them. Nay, a painter with a few lhells of colours‚ and the be-
nefit of his eye, and habit of his imagination‚ can imitate them all that e-
ver have been, arc, or may be, if they were brought before him. No-
thing more variable than voices, yet men ean likewise discern them perso-
nally3 nay, you lhall have abuffoou or Pantomimus‚ will express as many
as he pleaseth. Nothing more variable than the differing sounds of words,
yet men have found the way to reduce them to a few fitnple letters3 so that
it is not the insufficiency or incapacity of man's mind, but it is the remote
standing or placing thereof‘, that breedeth these mazes and incomprehen-
fions: for as the sense afar off is full of mistaking‚ but is exa& at hand, so
it is of the understanding5 the remedy whereof is not to quicken or
strengthen the orgari, but to go nearer to the objce‘m and therefore there is
no doubt, but if the phyficians will learn and use the truc approaehes and
avenues of nature, they may affume as much as the poet saith:

Et quoniam variant morbi, variabimus artes,
Mille mali species, mille solutis erunt.

Which that they stiould do, the nobleness of their art doth deservc‚ well
‘lhadowed by the poetS, in that they made AEfiulapius to be the son of the
sun, the one being the fountain of life, the other as the second stream3
but infinitely more honoured by the example of our Savtour, who made
the body of man the object of his miracles, as the soul was the objest of his
