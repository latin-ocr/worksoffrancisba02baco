OF THE ADVANCEMENT BooklI.

roa the one I have made as a parent, or common :incestor to all know-
ledge3 and the other Ihave now brought in, :is a braneh or descendent of
natiiral science3 it appeareth likewise that 1 have assigned to suminary phi-
losophy, the common principles and axioms which are promiscuous and
indifferent to several seiences: I have assigned unto it likewise the enquiry
touching the operation of the relative and adventive characters of css'cnces‚·
‚is quantity, similitude, divcrfity, poss'ibility‚ and the rests with this distinc-
tion and provisi0n3 that they be handled as they have efficacy in nature,
and not logically. It appearethlikewise‚ that natural theology> which herc-
tofore hath been handled confusedly with mctaphyfick, lliave inclosed and
bounded by it self.

IT is therefore now aqueffion, what is left remaining sor metaphysick3
wherein 1 may without prejudice preserve thus much ofthe conceit of an-
tiquity, that physici< should contemplate that which is inherent in matter,
and therefore transitory5 and metaphysick‚ that which is abstrasted and
fixed.

AND again, that phyfick should handle that which supposeth in nature
only a being and moving, and metaphyfiek should handle that which sup-
poseth farther in nature, a reason, understanding and platform: but the
difference perspicuoussy expressed‚ is most familiar and senfible.

Fon as we divided natural philosophy in general into the enquir'y of
causes and produitions of effeets, so that part which concerneth the enqui-
ry of causes we do subdivide, according to the received and found division of
causes; the one part, which is physick‚ enquireth and handleth the mate-
rial and efficient causes3 and the other, which is metaphysick‚ handleth the,
formal and final causes.

PHYs1c1<‚ (taking it according to the derivations‚ and not according to
our idion] for medicine) is fituate in a middle term or distance, between
natural history and inetaphysick. For natural history describeth the variety
of things, phyfick the causeS‚ bnt variable or rcspectix‘e causess and nieta-
phyfick the fixed and constant causes,

Limus ut hic damst-it, (ἐν haec ut cera liqmstin
Uno eodemque igni.

F 1 R E is the cause of indm-atlon, but respeffive to clay: Fire is the cause of
colliquation‚ but respeE'tive to wax. But fire is no constant cause either of
indurations or colliquation: so then the physical causes are but the efficience
and the matter.

PHYSICK harh three parts, whereof two respe& nature united or colle&-
ed, the third contemplateth nature diffused or distributed. Nature is colle&-
cd either into one entire total, or else into the sanie principles or seeds. So
as the first dochini: is touching the contexture or configuration of things, as
De mundo, de univerfitate rerum.

THE second is the doeh-ine concerning the principles or originals of
‘thingss the third is the doetrine concerning all variety and particularity
of things; whether it be of the differing substances, or their differing
qualitics and natures‚ whereof there needeth no enuincration3 this part be-
}pg but as a gloss or paraphrase that attendeth upon the text of natural hi·

ory.

OF these three Ι cannot report any as deficiens in what truth or perfec-
tion they are handled, lniake not now any judgment: but they are parts of
knowledge not desertcd by the labour of man.
