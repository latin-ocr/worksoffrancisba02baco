452 OF THE ADVAN‘CEMENT Bookn.

F 1 Rs Τ therefore, amongst so many great foundations of colleges in Eu-
rope, Ifind strange that they ate all dedicated to professions‚ and none left
free to arts and scieiices at large. For if men {Udge that learning should bc
referred to actions, they judge well ς but-in this they fall into the error dc-
scribed in the ancient suble, in which the other parts of the body did suppose
the stomach had been idle, because it neither performed the office 0f motion
as the limbs do, nor of sense, as· the head doth: but yet, notwithstanding,
it is the stomach that digesteth and distributeth to all the rest3 so if any man
think philosophy and universality to be idle studies, he doth not considet that
all profcssiOns a're from thence sctved and supplied. And this Itake to be
a great cause that hath hinder’d the progresslon of learning, because these
fundamental knowledges have been studied but in passage. For if you will
have a tree bear more fruit than i't hath used to do, it is not any thing
you can do to the boughs, but it is the stit-ring of the earth, and parting
new mould about the roots that must work it. N either is it to be forgotten‚
,that this dedicating of foundations and dotations to profcss'ory learning, harh
not only had a malign aspeffi'c and influence upon the growrh of sciences, but
hath also been prejudicial to states and governmcnts. For hence it proceed-
eth that princes find a solitude in regard of able men to serve them in causes
of estate, because there is no education collegiate which is free, where such
as were so disposed might give themselves to histor-ies, modern languages,
books of poliey and civil discourse‚ and other the like enablements unto
service of state.

A Νι) because founders of colleges do plant, and founders of lestures do
water, it followeth well in order to speak of the ticket, which is in pub-
lick lestureffi namely, in the smallness and meanness of the salary or rc-
ward‚ which in most places is assigued unto them ‚- whether they be leetutes
of arts·, or of profeffions. For it is necessary to the progr-essim] of semaces,
that readers be of the most able and sufficient men, as those which are or-
dained for generating and propagating of sticnees, and not sor tranfitory
use. This cannot be, except their condition and eudowment be such, as
may content vthe ablest man to appropriate his whole labour, and continue
his whole age in that funffion and attendance, and therefore must have a
proportion answcrable to that mediocrity or competency os advanccment‚
which may be expected from a profession, or the praeiice of a profeffion.
So as if you will have sciences flouriffi, you must observe ‘Da-vids military
law, which was, ‘⁴ That those which stay'd with the carriagq should have e-
“ qual part with those which were in the aetion ;'' else will the carriages be
ill attended. So readers in sciences are indeed the guardians of the stores,
and provisions of scienceS‚ whence men in afflve courses are furnished, and
therefore ought to have equal entertainment with them ,- otherwise if the
fathers in seienees be of the weakest sort or be ill maintained :

Et patrum invalidi referent jejunia nati.

ANoTHER defe& I note, wherein lshall need some alchymist to help
me, who call upon men to sell their books, and to build surnaces, quitting
and forsaking Minerva and the muses as barren virgins, and relying upon
Vulcan. But certain it is, that unto the deep, fruifful, and operat-ive study
of many scicnces, especially natural philosophy and phyfiek, books be not
only the instrumentals wherein also the beneficenee of men harh not been
altogether wanting: For we see spheres, globes‚ astrolabcs‚ maps, and thelik‘e,
have been provided as appurtcnances to astronoiny⁷ and colinography‚ as

well
