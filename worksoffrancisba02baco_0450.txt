OF THE 'ADVANCEMENT Bomkl.

where it is said ς “ 1f the Whiteness have over-spread the flesh, the patient may
“ pass abroad for 616311 ,- but if there be any whole 116111 remaining, he
‘⁴ is to be {hut up for unclean:” one of them noteth a principle of na-
ture, that putrefaeiion is more contagious before matur-ity, than after, And
another noteth 3 position of moral philosophy, that men abandoned 1011166,
do not so much corrupt manners, as those that are half good and half evil5
so in this, and very many other places in that law, there is to be found, be-
fides the theological sense, much asperfion of philosophy.

So likewise in that excellent book of Job, if it be revolved with dili-
gence, it will be found pregnant‚ and swelling with natural philosophy; as
for example, cosmography, and the soundness of the world : Qti extendit
aquilonem snper vacnum, όν appendit terram fitper nzhz’lums wherein the
pensileness of the earth, the pole of the north, and the finiteness or convexiry
of heaven are manifestly touched. So again, matter of astronomy3 Spiritus
ejus ornavit coelos ὠ obstetricante mann cjjus edm-7225 est colaber tortuosus.
And in another place ς Nunquz'd conjungere valebis micantes-[fellas pleiadas,
aut gyrum areium· poteris diffi'pare ,Ρ XVhere the fixing of the starS, ever
standing at equal distance, is with great elegancy noted. And in another
place, Otaifac’it arffztrztm, <ly oriona, dy hyadas, ὠ interiora arfirl' 3 where
again he takes knowledge of the depress'ion of the southern pole, calling ic
the secrets of the south, because the southern stars were in that climate
unseen. Mattcr of generation, Annon sicut lac mulsisti me, &¹ ficut casbum
coagulasti me, &a Matter of 11111161315, Habet argentum venarum sicarum
princzpia .· εἰν auro locus est m qno conflatur, ferrum de term tollitur, ᾤ’
lapis sblutus calore in aes vertitur: and so forwards in that chapter.

So likewise in the person of Salomon the king, we see the gift or 611110117-
1116111 of wisdom and learning both in Solomon's petition, and in God's ass'cnt
thereunto preferred before all other terrene and tempor-il felicity. By virtue
of which grant or donative of God, Solamen became enabled‚ not only
to write those excellent parables or aphoril'ms concerning divine and moral
philosophy3 but also to compile 3 natural history of all verdour, from
the cedar upon the mountain, to the moss upon the wall; (which is but
3 rudiment between putrefaffion and an herb) and-also of all things that
breathe 01111016. Nay, the [31116 Salomon the king, although he excelled
111 1116 glory of treasure and magnificent buildings, of stripping and navi-
gation, of service and 3116111131166, of fame and renown, and the 11116ς
yet he maketh 110 6131111 to any of those glories, but only to the glory of
inquisition of truth ς for so he saith cxprcssy, The glory of Gadis to conceal
a thing, but the glory ofthe king is to find it out ,- as if, according to the in—
nocent play of children, the divine majesty took delight to hide his works,
to the end tohave, them found out3 and as if kings could not obtain a
greater honour than to be God's playfellows in that game, confidering the·
great cominandment of wits and means, whereby nothing needeth to be
hidden from them.-

N 131 Til E R did the dispensation of God varyin the times after our Savi-
our came into the world; for our Saviour himself did first lhew his power to
subdue ignorancc‚ by his conference with the priest's and dostors of the law,
before he shewed his power to subdue nature by his miracles. And the
coming of the Holy Spirit, was chiefly figured and express'ed in the similitude
and gift of tongues, which are but vehicula scientiae.

So in the election of those instruments‚ which it plcased God to use for
1116 plantation of the saith, notwithstanding, that, at the first he did cm-

1210!
