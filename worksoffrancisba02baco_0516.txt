the nature of man so unfortunately built, as that those powers and arts
should have force to disturb reason, and not to establilh and advance it: for
the end of logici< is to teach a form of argument, to secure reason, and not
to intrap it. The end of morality, is to procure the affe-dions to obey reason,
and not to invade it. The end of rhetorick, is to fill the imaginarion to se-
cond reason, and not to oppress it ,ς for these abuses of arts come in but ex-
obliquo for cantion.

ΛΝΒ therefore it was great injustice in Plato, though springing out of a
just hatred of the rhetoricians of his time, tq‚estcem of rhetorici< but as a vo-
luptuary art, resembling it to cookery, that did mar wholsome meats, and help
unwholsome by variety of sauceS, to the pleasure of the taste. For we see
that speech is much more conversam in adorning that which is good, than in
colouring that which is evil; for there is no man but spcaketh more honest-
ly than he can do or think ς and it was excellently noted by Thucydides in
Cleon, that because he used to hold on the bad fide in causes of estate, there-
fore he was ever inveighing against eloquence and good speech, knowing that
no man can speak fair of courscs sordid and base. And therefore as Plato
said elegantly, “ That virtue, if ssie could be seen, would move great love
“ and affeetion :'' so seeing that ssie cannot be shewed to the sense by corpo-
ral stiape, the next degree is, to shew her to the imagination in lively repre·
sentation: for to lhew her to reason only in subtilty of argument, was a
thing ever derided in Chrysippus, and many of the Stoicks, who thought to
thrust virtue upon men by lharp disputations and conclufions‚ which have no
sympathy with the will of man.

Ao A IN, if the affefflons in themselves were pliant and obedient torea-
son, it were true, there should be no great use of persuasions and infinitations
to the will, more than of naked proposition and proofs ε but in regard of the
continual mutinies and seditions of the afferimus,

Reason would become captive and servile, if eloquence of persuafions did
not prastise ancl wiri the imagination from the affeffions part, and contra& a
confederacy between the reason and imagination, against the affeetions ε for

the affections themselves carry ever an appetite to good, as reason doth. The-

difference is, that the affection beholdeth merely the present, reason beholdeth
the future and sum of time. And therefore the present filling the imagina-
tion more, reason is commonly vanquissied3 but after that force of eloquence
and persuafion hath made things future and remote appear as present, then
upon the revolt of the imagination reason prevaileth.

We conclude therefore, that rhetorici< can be no more charged with ‘the‘
colouring of the worse part, than logick with sophistry, or morality with
vice. For we know the doctrines of contraries are the same, though the use
be opposite. It appeareth also, that logick differeth from rhetorick, not only
as the fist from the palm, the one close, the other at large ς but much more
in this, that logick handleth reason exact, and in truth3 and rhetorici< hand-
leth it as it is planted, in popular opinions and manners. And therefore
Aristotle doth wisely place rhetorici< as between logick on the one fide, and
moral or civil knowledge on the other, as participating of both : for the proofs
and demonstrations of logick‚ are toward alimen indifferent and the same :
but the proofs and persuasione of rhetorick, ought to differ according to 'the
auditors:
