grounded upon the conceit that the mind, as a mirror or glast, lhould take
illuminat'ion from the foreknowledge of God and spirits, unto which the
same regimem doth likewise conduce. For the retireing of the mind within
it sclf, is the state which is most susceptible of divine infirmioris, save thar
it is accompanicd in 'this case with a fervency and elevation, (which the
ancients noted by fury) and not with a repose and quiet, as it is in the
other.

FASCIN Α τ 10'N is the power and acl* of imagination, more intensive upon
o'ther bodies, than the body of the imaginant3 for of that we speak in the pro-
per places w'hcrein the school of Paracelstts, and the disciplcs of pretendcd
natural magick, have been so intemperate, as they have exalted the power of
'the imagination to be much one with the power ofmiracle-working saith:
‘others that draw nearer to probability, calling to their view the secret pas-
sages of things, and especially of the contagion that pass'eth fron] body to
body, do conceive it should likewise be agreeablc tonature, that there should
be some transmiflions and operations from spirit to spirit, without the ine-
diation of the sense33 whence the conceits have grown (now almost made
civil) of the mastering spirit, and the force of confidence and the like. Inci-
dent unto this is the inquiry how to raise and fortify the imagin-*tticum sor
if the imagination fortified have power, then it is material to know how
to fortify and exalt it. And hercin comes in crookedly and dangerou'ily, a
palliation of a great part of ceremonial magick. For it may be pretended,
that ceremonies, characters, and charnis, do work, not by any tacit or sa-
cramental conti-aet with evil spirits, but serve only to strengthen the imagi
nation of him that useth it3 as imagcs are said by the Roman chureh, to
fix the cogitatmus, and raise the devotions of them that prny before them.
But for mine own judgment‚ if it be admitted that imagination harh pow—
er, and that ccremonies fortify imagination, and that they be used {incerc-
ly and intentionally for that purpose3 yet I should hold them unlawful as
opposing to that first editt, which God gave unto man, In stidore vultus
comedes panem tunm. For they propound those noble cffcsfts which God
hath set forth unto man, to bc bought at the price of labour, to be attain-
ed by a few, easy, and ssothful obscrvanees. Deficiences in these know-
ledgesl will report none, other than the general deficiencc, that it is not
known how much of them is verity, and how much vanity.

T HE knowledge which respeE‘oeth the faculties of the mind of man, is of
two kinds3 the one respesting his understanding and reason, and the other
his will, appetite and affe-aiom whereof the former produceth direffion
or decree, the latter aetion or execution. Itis true that the imagination
is an agent or nuncius in both provinces, both the judicial and the ministe-
rIal. For sense sendeth over to imagination before reason have judged, and
reason sendeth over to imagination before the deeree can be astcd: for inia-
gination ever precedeth voluntary motion, saving that this Jcmus os inm-
gination hath differ-ing faces; for the face towards rssson hath the print of

truth, bfut the face towards aetion harh the print of good, which neverthe-
less arc aces:
