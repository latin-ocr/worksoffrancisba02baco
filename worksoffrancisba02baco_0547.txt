BookII. OF LEARNING‚

this will preserve men from soil, and not occnpy them too much about one
matter, wign opinion of moderatiou, please the most, and make a shcw ofa
perpetual iclieity in all they undertake, which cannot but mightily increase
reputation.

A No T H ER part of this knowledge seemcth to have sothe repugnancy
with the former two, but not as 1 understand it, and it is that which ‘Deumsthe-
nes uttereth in high terms: Et quemadmodum receptum est, ut exercitum
ducat imperatffl‘, stc ὠ a cordatis viris res ipfize ducendae ,- ut quae ipsis
videntur, ea gerantur, dy uon zpsz eventus tantum persequi cogantur. For
if we observe, we shall find two differing kinds of sufficieney in managing of
business, some can make use of occasions aptly and dexteroussy‚ bnt plot little ‚-
some ean urge and pursue their own plots well, but cannot accommodatenor
take in3 either of which is very imperfec‘t without the other.

A No τ HE R part of this knowledge is the obser-ving a good rnediocrity in
the deelaring‚ or not deelaring a man's self: for although depth of scemsy,
and making way (qualis cst via navis in mari, which the French calleth
Sourdes Menees, when men set things in work without opening themselves
at all) be sometimes both prosperons and admirable, yet many times ‘Diffi-
mulatio errores parit, qui dzjfflmulatorem ipsum illaqueant. And therefore
we see the greatest politicians have in a natural and free manner profess'ed
their defires, rather than been reserved and disguised in them: for so we see
that Lucius Sylla made a kind of profeffion, “ that he wilhed all men happy
“ or unhappy, as they stood his friends or enemics.’' So Caesar when he
went first into Gaul, made no scruple to profess, “ that he had rather be first
“ in a village, than second at Rome.'' So again, as soon as he had begun the
war, we see what Cicero saith of him, Alter (meaning of Caesur) non recu-
fizt, sed quodam modo postulat, ut, ut est, stc appelletur tyrannus. So we
may see in a letter of Cicero to Atticus, that Augustus Caesar in his very
entrance into affairs, when he was a darling of the senate, yet in his harangues
to the people would swear: Itu parentis honores consequi liceat, (which
was no less than the tyranny :) save that to help it, he would stretch forth his
hand towards a statue of Caefizr'S, the which was erected in the same place,
whereat many men laughed and wondred and said, is it poffible? Or, did you
ever hear the like to this ? And yet thought he meant no hurt, he did it so
handsomely and ingenuoussy3 and all these were prosperous: whereas Pom-
pey, who tended to the same ends, but in a more dark and diffembling man-
ner, as Tacitus saith of him, occultior, uon melior, wherein Sallust coneur-
reth, ore probo, animo inverecundo, made it his defign by infinite secret engines',
to cast the state into an absolute anarchy and confusion, that the state might
cast itself into his arms for neccffity and protection, and so the sovereign
power be put upon him, and he never seen init: and when he had brought
it (as he thought) to that point when he was chosen consul alone, as never
any was, yet he could make no great matter of it, because men understood
him not3 but was fain in the end, to go the beaten track of getting arms
into his hands, by colour of the doubt of Caefizr's defigns: so tedious, ca-
sual, and unfortunate are these deep diffimulations, whereof it seemeth Ta-
citus made this judgrnem, that they were a cunning of an inferior forna in
regat-d of true poliey, attributing the one to Augustus, the other to Tiberzuq,
where speaking of Livia, he saith, Et cum artibus mame· simulatione filu
bene composita 3 for surely the continual habit of diffimulation is but a weak

and ssuggilh cunning, and not greatly politick. A t
