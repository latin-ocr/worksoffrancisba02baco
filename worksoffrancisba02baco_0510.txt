OF THE ADVANCEMENT BookII·

THIS art of memory is but built upon two intentions; the one pre-
notion, the other emblem. Prenotion dischargeth the indefinite secking
of that we would remembcr, and dii-ecleth us to feel< in a nari-ow com-
pas53 that is, somewhat that hath congruity with our place of memory.
Emblem redueeth coneeits intellechial to images senfiblc, which strike the
memory mores out of which axioms may be drawn much better prac-
tick than that in use: and bcfides which axioan, there are divers more
touching the help of memory, not inferior to them. But 1 did in the be-
ginning distinguish, not to report those things deficient, which arc but only
ill managed.

THERE remaincth the fourth kind of rational knowledge, which is
transitive, concerning the expressing or transferring our knowledge to others,
whichI will term by the general name of tradition or delivery. Tradi-
tion hath three parts: the first concerning the organs of tradition3 the se-
cond, concerning the method of traditi0n3 and the third, concerning the
illustration of tradition.

Fon the organ of tradition, it is either speech or writing: For Argstotle
saith well, “ W ords arc the images of cogitations, and letters arethe images
“ of words;'' but yetit is not of necessity that cogitations be expreffed by the
medium of words. For whatsoever is capable of sufficient differenceS, and
those perceptible by the sense, is in nature competent to express cogita-
tionS. And therefore we see in the commeree of barbarous people, that
understand not one another’s language, and in the practice of divers that are
dumb and deaf, that mens minds are express'cd in gestures, though not ex-
affly, yet to serve the turn. And we understand farther, that it is the use
of China, and the kingdoms of the high Levant, to write in charafi‘ers
real, which express neither letters nor words in gross, but things or notions;
insomuch as countreys and provinces, which understand not one another’s
languagc, can neverthcless read one another'swritings, because the characters
are accepted more generally than the languages do extend3 and therefore-
they have a vast multitude of characieff, as many (Ι suppose) as radical
words. ’

THEsE notes of cogitations are of two sorts; 2 thc one when the note hath
some similitude or congruity with the notion3 the other ad placitum, ha-
ving force only by conti-aet or acceptation. Of the former sort arc hierogly-
phicks and gestures. For as to hieroglyphicks, (things of ancient use, and
embraced chiefly by the AEgyptians‚ one of the most ancient nations) they
are but as continued impresses and emblems. And as for gestures, they
are as transitory hieroglyphicks, and are to hieroglyphicks as words spoken
are to ¹words written, in that they abide not: but they have evermorc as
well as the other an affinity with the things fignified3 as Periander being
consulted with how to preserve a tyranny newly usurped, bid the messen-
gcr attend and report what he saw him do, and went into his garden and
topped all the highest flowers3 fignifying, that it consisted in the cutting
off and keeping low of the nobility and grandees: ad placitum are the cha-
racters real before mention'd, and words: although some have been willing
by curious inquiry, or rather by apt feigning, to have derived imposition of
names from reason and intendment3 a speculation elegant, and by reason it
searchcth into antiquity reverent3 but sparingly mix’d with truth, and of

De ”0²³⁵ re· small fruit. This portion of knowledge, touching the notes of things, and

Iun]-

cogitations in general, Ifind not inquired, but deficient. And although it
may seem of no great use, consider-ing that words and writings by letters, do
far
