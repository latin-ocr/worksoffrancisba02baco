Amtomia IN the inquiry which is made by anatomy‚ Ι find much deficienee: for
⁶0¹¹¹P²¹2‘³‘ they inquire o'r' the parts, and their substances, figures and collocations;
but they inquire not of the diver-sities of the parts, the seer-ecies of the pas-
sages, and the scats or nestlings of the humours, nor much of the footsteps
andimprefiions of diseases3 the reason of which ‘omifl'ron Isuppose to·be;
because the first inquirymay be satisfied in the view of one or a few una*—
tomies; but the latter being, comparative and casual, must arise from the
view of many. And 35 to the divei·fity of parts, there 15 110 doubt but the
facture or fmming of the inward parts is as full of difference as the ont-
ward, and in that is the cause continent of many (11103105, which notbeirig
obser-ved, they quarrel many times with the humours which are nor'in
fault, the fault being in the very frame and mechanici< of the part, which
0311110( be removed by medicine alterative, but must 110 30001111110(13(0(1 and
palliated by diets and medicines familiar. And for the [13113505 and potes,
it is true which was anciently noted, that the more subtile of them appear
not in anatomies, because they are ssiut and latent in dead bodies, though
γ they be open and manifest in life: which being supposed, though (1101111311-
manity of anatomia vivorum was by Celsus justly rcproved3 yet in regat-d of
the great use of this observation, the inquiry needed not by him so ssightly
to have been relinquilhed altogether, or referred to the casual practices of
lurgery, but might have been well diverted upon (111100ὶί011 of beasts 3-
live, which notwithstanding the diflimilitude of their parts, may sufficient-
ly satisfy this inquii-y. And for the humours'thcy are commonly passed
