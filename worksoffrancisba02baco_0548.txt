OF THE ADVANCEMENT Dockll.

A No T H ER precept ofthis architectum of fortune 15, to accustom our
minds to judge of the proportion or value of thingS, as they conduce 31111
316 1113161131 10 our particular ends, and that to do substantially and nor super-
ficially. For we {hall find the logical part (as Ι may term it) of some mens
minds good, but the mathematical part· erroneous; that 15, they can well
judge of consequences, but not of proportions and comparisons, preferring
things of 1116117 and sense before things of substance and effect. So some fall
111 love with access to princes, others with popular fame and applause, sup-
posing they are things of great purchase3 when in many cases they are but
matters of envy, peril, and impediment.

So some measure things according to the labour and difficulty, or affi-
duitv, which 316 spent about them3 and think if they be ever moving‚ that
they must needs advance and proceed, as Caefizr 131111 ina despising manner of-
Cafo the second, when 116 describeth how laborious and indefatigable he was
to no great purpose: Haec omnm magno studio agebat. So in most things
men are ready to abuse themselves in thinking the greatest 11163115 10 be best,
when it should be the fittest.

As for the true marshalling of mens pursuits towards their fortune, 35
they are more or less material, 1 hold them to stand thus: first the amend-
ment of their own minds; for the remove of the impediments of the mind
will sooner clear the passages of fortune, than the obtaining fortune will
remove the impediments of the mind. ln second place 1 set down wealth
and 11163115, which Ι know most men would have placed first, because
of the general use which it beareth towards 311 variety of occafions.
But that opinion Ι may condemn with like reason as Machiavel doth
that other, that monies were the finews of the wars, whereas (saith he)
the 11361175 of the wars are the 11361175 of men’s arms, that is, a valiant,
populous and military nati0n3 and he voucheth aptly the authority of
Solon, who when Croefits shewed him his treasury of gold, said to
him, that if another 63316 that had better iron he would be master of his
gold. In like manner it may be truly affirmed, that itis 1101 11103165 11131 316
1116 finews of fortune, but it is the finews and steel of mens minds, wit,
courage, audacity, resolution, temper, industry, 31161 1116 like. In third place,
Iset down reputation, because of the peremptory 111165 and currents it harh,
which if they be not taken in their due time are seldoni recovered, it being
extream hard to play an after-game of reputation. And lastly, 1 place ho-
nour, which is more easily 11703 by any of the other three, much more by all,
than any of them can be purchased by honour. To conclude this precept,
as there is order and priority in matter, so is there in time, the preposte-
rous placing whereof is one of the commonest errors, while men fly to
their ends when they should intend their beginnings ς and do not take things
in order of time as they corne on, but marshal them according to greatness,
and not according to instance, not observing the good precept, Quod nunc
mstat agamus.

ANOTHER precept of this knowledge, is not to embrace any matters
which do occupy too great a quantity of time, but to have that founding in
a man's ears, Sed fltgit interea, fugit irreparabile tempus: and that, is the
cause why those which-take their course of rising by profeffions of burden,
af> lawyer8‚ marom, painful divines, and the like, are not commonly so poli,-
t1ck for their own fortuncs, otherwise than in their ordinary way, because

they want time tolcam particulam, to wait oceafions, and to ἀενίἕὶε plots.
