PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT

ΟΝ which monday the lord chancellor sent the sar-ne accordingly, and,
that follows in haec verba, viz.

‘Io the rtght honourable the lords spiritual and temporal in rthr high court.
esparliament afflmbled:

The humble confession and submiffion of me the iord chancellor.

UPON advised consideration of the charge, deseending into my own com
seience, and calling my memory to account, so far as 1 am able, 1 do
plainly and ingenuoussy confess that I am guilty of corruption, and do
renounce all defenoe, and put my self upon the grace and merey of your
lordlhips.

THE particulars I confess, and declare to be as followcth.

To the first article of the charge, viz. in the cause between fir Row·
land Egerton and Edward Egerton, the lord chancellor received 300l. on
the part of fir Rowland Egerton‚ before he had decreed the cause. ·

I do confess and declare, that upon a reference from his majesty of alei
suits and controversies between fir Rowland Egerton and Edward Egerton,
both parties submitted themselves to my award by recognizances reciprocal
in ten thousand marks apieee3 thereupon, after divers hearings, I made
my award with the advice and consent of my lord Hobard: the award was
perfected and publiihed to the parties, which was in February. Then
some days after, the three hundred pounds, mentioned in the charge, was
delivered unto me. Afterwards Mr. Edward Egerton fied off from the
award3 then in midsummet term following a suit was begun in chancery
-by fir Rowland to have the award confirmed, and upon that suit was the
decree made mentioned in the article.

THE second article of the charge, viz. in the same cause he received
from Edward Egerton 400 l.

Iconfess and declam, that soon after my first coming to the seal, being
a time when l was presented by many, the 400 l. mentioned in the said
charge, was delivered unto me in a pnrse, and, as Ι now call to mind,
from Mr. Edward Egerton3 but as far asI can remember, it was exprest
by them that brought it to be for favours past, and not in respe& of favours
to come.

THE third article of the charge, viz. in the cause between Hody and
Ηοιζν, he received a dozcn of bnttons of the value of 50 l. about a fort—
night after the cause was ended:

1 confess and declare, that as it is laid in the charge about a fortnight
after the cause was ended, it being a suit for a great inheritance, there
were gold buttons about the value of 50 l. as is mentioned in the charge
presented unto me, as Ι remember, by sir Thomas Perrot and the party
himself.

To the fourth article of the charge, viz. in aeause between the lady
Wharton and the coheirs of fir Francis Willoughby, hc received of the lady
tharton three hundred and ten pounds:

I confess and declare, that I did receive of the lady tharton‚ at two
several times, as 1 remember in gold, 200 l. and 100 pieces; and this was
certainly pendente lite: but yet I have a vehement inspicion that there was
some ihuffling between Mr. Shute and the register in cntring some orders
which afterwardsl did distaste.

To the fifth article of the charge, viz. in sir Thomas Rffonk’s eausc'he

received
