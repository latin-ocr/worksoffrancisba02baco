B00k1. OF LEARN'ING.

eyes upon prineeS‚ isin the outward ccremouy barbarous, but the moral is
good: for men ought not by cunning and bent obser-various, to pietce
and penetrate into the hearts of mags, which the scripture hath declared
to bc inscrutable.

THERE is yet another fault (with which Ι will 'conclude this part)
which is often noted in learned men, that they do many times fail to ob-
serve decency and discretion in their behaviour and carriage, and commit
crrors in small and ordinary points of aetion, so as the vulgar sort of capa-
cities do make a judgment of them in greater matters, by that which
they find wanting in them in smaller. But this consequence doth often
deceive men, for which 1 do refer them Over to that which was said by
Themistocles arrogantly and uncivilIy, being applied to himself out of his
own mouth, but being applied to the general state of this question perti-
nently and justly; when being invited to touch a Inte, he said, “ He could
“ not fiddle, buthe could make a small town a great state.'' So, no doubt,
many may be well seen in the passages of govetnment and policy‚ which
are to scel< in little and punfflml occasions. 1 refer them also to that which
Plato said of his master Socrates, whom hc compared to the gallypots of
apothecaries, which on the outside had apes and owIs, and antiques, but
contained within fove-reign and precious liquors and c011feffi01153 ac-
knowledging that to an external tepor-t, he was not Without superficial le-
vities and deformities‚ but was inwardly replenilhed with excellent vir-
tues and powers. And so much touching the point of manners of learned
men.

Bur in the mean time I ha‘ve no purpose to give allowance to some
conditions and courses base and unworthy, wher‘ein divers profcss'ors of
learning have wronged themselch and gone too far3 such as were those
trencher philosopth which in the later age of the Roman state were usu·
all-y in the houses of great persons, being little better than solemn para-
fitcs; of which kind anian maketh a merry description of the philos07
phet that the great lady took to ride with her in her coach, and would
needs have him carry her litte dog, which he doing officioussy‚ and yet
uneomer, the page scoffcd, and said, “ That he doubted, the philosopher
“ of a Stoici< would turn to be a Cynick.” But above all the rest, the gross
and palpable flattery whereunto many (not unlearned) have abased and
abused their wits and pens, turning (as Du Bartas faith) Hecuba into He-
lena, and Faustina into Lucretia, hath most diminished the price and esti-
mation of learning. Neither is the modern dedications of books and wri-
tings‚ as to patrous, to bc commended: for that books (such as are worthy
the name of books) ought to have no patrous but truth and reason. And
the ancient custom wa3‚ to dedicate them only to private and cqual friends,
or to entitle the books with their names3 or if to kings and great per-
sons, it was to some such as the argument of the book was fit and pro<
per for: but these and the like courses may desetve rather reprehcnfi0n
than defence.

ed men to men in fortune. For the answer was good that Diogenes made
to one that asked him in mockery: “ How it came to pass that philosophers
“ were the followets of rich men, and not rich men of philosophers?''
He answered soberly‚ and yet {harplyt “ Because the one sort knew what
“ they had need of, and the other did not.’' And of the like nature was
the answer which Aristzppus made, when having a petition to Ἑίυηνβῑιὲ
