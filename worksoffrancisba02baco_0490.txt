be the more artificial and serviceable, if to every reputed impoffibility, you
add what thing is extant, which cometh the nearest in degree to that
impofl'lbility3 to the end, that by these optatich and potentiaIS, man's in-
quiry may be the more awake in deducing direclion of wei-ks from the spe-
culation of causes: And secondly, that those experiments be not only c·
steemed which have au immediate and present use, but those principally
which are of most universal consequence sor invention of other experiments,
and those which give most light to the invention of cauit-53 for the inven-
tion ofthe marincrs ncedle, which givcth the direction, is of no less benc-
fit for navigation, than the invention osthe sails which give the motion.

THUS havclpass'ed through natural philosophy, and the deiicicncies there·
of, wherein if I have differed from the antient and received doctrines, and
thereby shall move contradictiom for my part, as I affe& not to diffeut, sot
purpose not to contenti, ifit be truth.

 

Non canimus fitrdis, respondent omniasyl-vae:

The voice of nature will consent, whether the voice of man do or no.
And as Alexander Borgia was wont to say, of the expedition of the French
for Naples, that they came with chalk in their hands to mark up their
lodgings, and not with weapons to fight: So I like better that entry of ttuth
which cometh peaceably with chalk, to marl< up those minds which are
capable to lodge and harbour it, than that which cometh with pugnacity
ancl contention.

Bur there remaineth a division of natural philosophy, according to the
report of the inquiry, and nothing conceruing the matter or subice& and
that is pofitive and considerative3 when the inquiry reporteth either an asa
sertion‚ oradoubt: these douth, or κω] liquets, are ostwolsorts, particular
and total. For the first, we sec a good example thereos in Argslotle's Pro-
blems, which deserved to have had a better continuancc; but so neverthe⁴
less, as there is one point whcreofwarning is to be given and taken. The re⁴
gistring of doubts harh two excellent uses: The one, that it saveth philo—
sophy from errors and falihoods‚ when that which is not fully appearing is
not collected into assertion, whereby error might draw error, but reservcd in
doubt. The other, that the entry of doubts are as so many suckcrs or sponges
to draw use of knowledges insomuch‚ as that which if doubts had not pre-
ceded, a man should never have advised, but passed it over without note,
hythe suggestion and solicitation of doubts is made to be attended and ap-
plied. But both these commodities do scarcely couutervail an inconvenience
which will intrude itself‚ if it be not debarred3 which is that, when a doubt
is once received, men labour rather how to keep it a doubt still, than how
to solve it, and accordingly bend their wits. Of this we see the familiar ex-
ample in lawyers and scholars, both which, if they have once admitted a
doubt, it goeth ever after authorized for a doubt: But that use of wit and
knowledge is to be allowed which laboureth to make doubtful things cer-
tain, and not those which labour to make certain things doubtful. There-
fore these kalendar-s of doubts l commend as excellent thing-15, so that
there be this caution used, that when they bc' throughly fiftcd and brought
to resolution, they be from thenceforth omitted, discat-ded, and not conti-
nued to cheriih and encourage men in doubting. To which kalendar of
doubts or problems, Iadvise to be annexcd another kalendar, as much or
more material, which is a kalendar of popular errors‚ 1 mean chiefly in
natural history, such as pass iu speech and conceit, and arcnevcrthelelk ap-
