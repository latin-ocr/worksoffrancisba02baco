PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT, διο.

ΤΗ 1R DLY, sn· George Hastings' testimony thereof5 which was not volun·
tar ‚ but urged.

{oon T H L r, the lord chancellor defired fir George qulings to bring the
party Awbrcfy ωηο him3 and promised redrcss of the wrong donc him.

ΙΞΙΡτι-ιωῐ,Ν that the iord chancellor said unto str George Hallingss ifhe
would affirm the giving of this 100 l. his lotdlhip would and must deny
it upon his honour.

THE case of fir EdwardEgerton is this: there being divers suits between
Edward Egerton and sir Rwland E gerton in the chancer->⁷5 Eclward Eger-
ton presented his lordship a little after he was lord keeper with a bason
and ewer of 50l. and above, and afterwards he delivered unto sn· George
Hastings and {ir RichardYozmg 400l. in gold, to be presented unto his lord-
ssaip; fir Richard Youngpresented it, his lordlhip took it, and poised [it]‚ and
said it was too mueh3 and returned answer, that Mr. Egerton had not only
enriched him, but had laid a tye upon his lordlhip to do him favour in all
his just causes.

THE proofs are the testimony of fir George Hastings, and the testimony
of Alerefil a serivcner, thus far: that he took up 700l. for Mr. Egerton‚
Mr. Egerton then telling him that a great part of it was to be given to the
lord chancellom and that Mr. Egerton afterwards told him that the 400l.
in gold was given to the lord chancellor. At this eonferenee was farther
declarcd of a biffiop, who was touched in this bufiness, upon the bye, whose
funCtion was much honoured, but his person touched herein: this bufiness
depending being ordered against Edward Egerton‚ he procu red a new refe-
rence thereof from the king to the lord chancellor: his lordship demanded
the parties to be bound in 6000 marks, to stand to his lordship's award:
they having entred into that bond, his londlhip awarded the matter against
EdwardEgerton for fir Rowland Egert0n3 and EdwardEgerton refusmg to
stand to the said award, a new bill was exhibited in the cl1ancc1-y3 and
thereupon his lordlhip ordered that his bond of 6000 marks should be
affigned unto fir Rowland Egerton‚ and he to put the same in suit in his
lordship's name.

ΤΗ E bilhop of Landaff, as afriend to Mr. EdwardEgertm, adviseth with
Randolph Damport and Butler, (which Butler is now dead,) that they would
procure a stay of the decree of that award, and procure a new hearing:
it was agreed that 6000 marks should be given for this by Edward Egert0n‚
and ihared amongst them, and amongst certain noble persons.

A reeognizance of 10000l. was required from Mr. Egerton to the bissiop
for the persor-manee hei-eof: the biihop his share of this 6000 marks was
to have [been] so great, as no court of justice would allow: they produce letters
of the bishop naming the sum, ancl setting down a course how this 6000
marks might be raised, viz. the land in question to be decreed for Mr.
Egert0n‚ and out of that the money to be levied; and if this were not ef-
secred, then the bishop in verbo sacerdotis promised to deliver up this
recognizanee to be cancelled. The new recognizance is scaled accordingly,
and Randolph Damport rides to the court, and moved the lord admiral for
his lordship's letter to the lot'd chaneellor herein3 but his lordihip denied
to meddle in a cause depending in suit.

THEN the said Randolph ‘Damport affayed to get the king's letter, but
failed therein also: so> that the good they intended to Mr. Egerton was not
effecteds and-yet the bistiop, tho' required, refused to deliver up the said

recogni-
