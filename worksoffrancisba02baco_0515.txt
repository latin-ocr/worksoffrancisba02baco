action: that is, from the greatest generality, to the most particular precept:
The one givcth rulc how far one knowledge ought to intermeddle within
the province of another, which is the rule they call κκθκιτδ · the other give-th
rnle, tinto what degree of particularity a knowledge lhould descend: which
later 1 find pass'ed over in silence, being in my judgtnent the more material :
for certainly there must be. soniewhat left to practice 3 but how much is wor⁴
thy the inquity. We see remote and superficial generalities ‘do but offen
knowledge to scoth of praciic-al nien, and are no more aiding to praefice,
'than an Ortelt'tts’s universal map is to direct the way between London and
York. The better sort of rules have been not unfitly compared to glass'es of Dc prodvc-
'steel unpolifhed3 where you may see the images of thing3‚ but first they must “0¹³² ³²³¹ffl¹³
be filed : so the rules will help, if they be labouted and polilhed by practice. ΠΜ
But how crystalline they may be made at the first, and hOw far forth they
may be polistied aforehand, is the question ‚- the inquii-y whereof seemeth to'
me deficient. .

Tuane hath been also laboured, and put in practice, a method‚ which
is not a law-ful method‚ but a method of imposture, which is to deliver
knowledges in such manner as men may speedily come to make a shew of
learning, who have it not; such was the ttavel of Ramundas Lullms in mal<-
ing that art, which bears his name, not unlike to some books of typocos-
*my which have been made since, being nothing but a mass of words of all
'arts‚ to give men countenance‚ that those which use the terrm, might
'be thought to understand the art3, which collections are much like a
fripper's or broker's lhop, that hath ends of every thing, but nothing of
worth. Δ

Now we descend to that part which concerneth the illustration of tradi,-
ti0n‚ eomprehended in that science which we call rhetorick, or art of elo-
quence3 a science excellent, and excellently well laboured. Por although in
true value it is inferior to wisdom, as it is said by God to Moses, when he
*disabled himself for want of this faculty, Aaron fhall'be thy speaker, and
-thon [halt be 'to hjm as God. Yet with People itis the more mighty: Fo'r
so Salomon saith, Sapiens corde appellabitur prudens, sed dulcis eloquio ma-
jorareperiet ,- fignifying, -that profoundness of wisdom will help a man to a
’name ot admiration, but that it is eloquence· that prevaileth in an aestive life 3
and as to 'the labouring of it, the emulation of Aristotle, with the rhetori.-
cians of his time, ancl the expetience of Cicero, hath made them in their
'works of rhetoricks exceed themselves. Again‚ the excellency of example&
-of eloquenoe in the orations of Demosthenes and Cicero, added to the per-
fection of the precepts of eloquence‚ hath doubled the ptogreffiont in this
art: and therefore the deficieneies which 1 shall note, will tathei· bev in some
2'eollcc3ions‚ which· may as hand-maids attend the art, than in the -rules or use
-of the att it sclf. ⁴ Ι y « . ·. 2. Δ

seleuce, as we have done of the rest 3 the duty and office of rhetotick is to
‘apply reason to imagimtion‚ for the better moving of the Will z. for we see
‘reason is disturbed in the administration thereos by three means; by illaquea-
'tion ot sophilin, which pertains to logick3 by imagination or imprcflion,
which permitis to rhetorick 3 and by-paffion oi· affeciion, which pertains to
morality. And as in negotiation with others, mcii are wrought by. cun-
