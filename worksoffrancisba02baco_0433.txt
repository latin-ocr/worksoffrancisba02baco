Eookl. OFLEARNING.

A Nl) sor matter of policy and government‚ that learning should rather
hutt than enable thereunm, is a thing very improbable: We see it is ac·
counted an error, to commit a natural body to empirici< phyficians, which
commonly have a few pleasmg rcccipts‚ whercupon they are confident and
advexiturous, but know neither the causes of diseases, nor the compl-exions
, os patients, —nor petil of accidents, nor the true method of cures: we ‘see
it is a like error to rely upon advocates or lawyers, which are only men os
praelice, and not grounded in their books, who are many times easily sur-
prised‚ when matter fallcth out belides their experience‚· to the prejudice of
the causes they handle: so by like reason it cannot be but a matter of
doubtful consequence, if states be managed by empirick statesmen, not·
well mingled with men grounded in learning. But eontrariwise, it is al-
most without instance contraditiory, that ever any government was disa-
stmuS, that was in the hands of learned governourS. For howsoever it hath
been ordinary with politick men to extenuate and disable learned men by the
names of pedants: yet in the records of time it appeareth in many particu-
lars, that the governments of princes in minority (notwithstanding the infi-
nite disadvantage of that kind of state) have nevertheless excelled the go-
vernment of princes of mature age, even for that reason which they seek
to traduce, which iS, that by that occasion the state hath been in the hands
ot'pedants: for so was the state of Rome for the first five years, which are
so much magnified, during the minority of Nero, in the hands of Seneca a
pet-lant: So it was again for ten years space or more, during the minority
os Gordianus the younger, with great applause and contentation in the hands
of Alfithelts a pedant: so was it before that, in the minority of Alexander
Severus in like happiness, in hands not much unlike, by reason of the rule
of the women, who were aided by the teachers and preceptors. Nay, let
a man look into the government of the bilhops of Rome, as by name, into
the government of 'Pius Quintus, and Sextus „Quintus in our times, who were
both at their entrance esteemed but as pedantical friars, and he shall find
that such popes do greater things, and proceed upon truer principles of
state, than those which have ascended to the papacy from an education
and breeding in affairs of state, ancl courts of prince83 for although men
bred in learning are perhaps to secl< in points of convenience, and accom-
modating for the present, which the Italiam call Ragioni alisiam, whereof
the same ‘Pius §Quintus could not hear spoken with patience, terming them
inventions against religion and the moral virtues; yet on the oher
side to recompence that, they are perfeet in those same plain grounds of
religion, justice, honour, and moral virtue3 which if they be well and
watchfully purffied, there will be seldom use of those other, no more than
ofphyfick in a found or well dieted body. Ncither can the experience of
one man's lise, furnish examples and precedents for the events of one
man's life: for as it happeneth sometimes, that the grand-child, or other
descendent, resembleth the ancestor more than the son3 so many times oc-
currences of present times may sort better with ancient examples than with
those os the later, or immediate times: and lastly‚ the wit of one man can
no more countervail learning, than one man's means can hold way with a
common purse.

AND as for those particular seducements‚ or indispofitions of the mind
for policy and government‚ which learning is pretended to infinuates if it
be granted that any such thing be, it must be remembred withal‚ that

learning ministreth in every of them greater strength of medicine or renge-
