OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookn'.

Bur this difference is not amiss to be temnunt-cd, that as history of
times is the best ground for discourse of government, such as stlachiavel
handleth‚ so history of lives is the most proper for discourse of business, because
it is more conversam in private astions. N ay, there is a ground of discourse
for this purpose fitter than them both, which is discourse upon letters; such
as are wise and weighty‚ as many are of Cicero ad Atticum, and others,
For letters have a great and more particular representation of business, than
either chronicles or lich. Thus have we spoken both of the matter and form
of this part of civil knowledge touching negotiation, which we note to be
deficient.

Bu T yet there is another part of this part, which differeth as much from
that whereof we have spoken, as sapere and fibi sapere 5 the one mov-mg as
it were to the circumferencc, the other to the center : for there isa wisdom
of counsel‚ and again there is a wisdom of prcffing a man's own fortune, and
they do sometimes meet and often sever: fot many are wisc in their own
ways that are weak for government or counsel, like antS, which is a wise creass
ture for itself but very hurtful for the garden. This wisdom the Romam-
did take much knowledge of: Nam pol sapiens <saith the comical poet)
fingit fhrtunam fibi ς audit grew to an adage‚ Faber qmsque fortunae pro-
priae: and Livy attributeth it to Cato the first, in hoc viro tanta vis ani·
mi c& ingenii inerat, ut quocunque loco natus effet, filu· ipfi jhrtunam fhcss

s videretur.
ΜῖΙέιΗ 1 s conceit or position, if it be too much declared and profcffed‚ hath

been thought a thing impolitick and unlucky, as was obscrvcd in Timotheus
the Athenian ‚- who having done many great services to the estate in his go-
vernment‚ and giving an account thercof to the people as the manner was, did
conclude every particular with this clause, “ and in this fortune had no part.''
And it came so to pass that he never prospercd in any thing he took in hand
afterwards ς for this is too high and too arrogant, favouring of that which

zekiel saith of Pharaoh, Dicis, fluvius est meas, civ ego feci memettpfitm:
or of that which another Prophet speaketh, That men off‘er sacrzfices to
their nets andfizares ς and that which the Poct express'eth,

{Dextra mihi Deus, όν telum, quod mtffi'le libro,
Nunc adstnt .·

For these confidences were ever unhallowcd, :md unblessed: and therefore
those that were great politicians indeed ever ascribed their success'es to their
fclicity‚ and not to their skill or virtue. For so Sylla sirnamcd himself Fe-
lix, not Magnus ,· So Caesar said to the master of the lhip, Caesarem portas·
ἐν fortunam ejus.

Βυτ yet nevertheless. these pofitions, Faber quisque fortunae fitae3 Sapi-
ens dominabitur astris: Invia virtuti nulla est via, and the like, being taken
and used as spurs to industry‚ and not as stirrups to insolency, rather for reso-
lution than for presumption or outward declaration, have been ever thought
sound and good, and are (no question) imprinted in the greatest minds, who,
are so scnfiblc of this opinion, as they can scarcc contain it within: As we
sce in Augzgllus Cacsszr, (who was rather diverse from his uncle, than infe—
rior in virtue) how when he died, he dcfircd his friends abour him to give
him a Plaudite, as if he were conscicnt to himself that he had play'd his
part well upon the stage. This part of knowledge we do report also as de-
ficient5 not but that it is prafflsed too much, but it hath not been reduced
to writing. And therefore lest it should seem to any that it is not com-

prehenfible
