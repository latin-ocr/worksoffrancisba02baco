N ec vultu destrue verba tuo. A man may destroy ,the force of > his -wo‘rds

tam claufiim. “ lt is nothing >von to admit men with an open door, and* to·
‘⁴ receive them with a {hut and reservcd countenance.'’ So we see Atticus,
before the first interview between Caesar and Cicero, the wat dependinggdid
l'erioussy advise Cicero touching the composing and ordering os his countez⁴
nance and gesture. And if the government of the countenance be of such,-
effect, mucii more is that of the speech, and other carriage appertains
ing to converspti0n3 the true model whereof seemeth to me well express'ed.
by Livy, though not meant for this purpose ,- Ne aut arrogans videar, aut
obnoxias ς quorum alterumbest alienae libertatis obliti, alterum sitae: “ Thr.
ὰ sum of behaviour is to retain a man’s own dignity‚ without intruding upon
“ the liberty of others.” On the other fide,- if behaviour and. outward car-
riage be intended too much, first it may pass into affectatiom and then Qid
clcformius quam stenam *in ,vitam transferre, to a& a man's life? Bur al-
though it proceed not to that extreme, yet it consumeth time‚ and employeth
the mind too much. And therefore as we use to advise young students from
company keeping, by saying, Amici, fures tempori53 so certainly the in-
tending of the discretion of bchaviour is a great thies of meditation. Again3
such as are accomplished in that form of urbanity, please themselves in ir,
and. seldom aspire to higher virtue5 whereas those that have dese& init,
do scek comelincss by reputation z for where reputation is, almost every
thing becometh3 but where that is not, it must be supplied by Panto's and
complements. ¹Agzstn, there is no greater impediment of aetion, than an
over-curious observance of decency‚ and the gulde of decency‚ which is time
and season. For as Solamen saith, Qti respicit adventas, non seminat ς &-
qui respicitad nubes, non metet.- A man must make his opportunity as oft
as find it. To conclude 3 behaviour seemeth to me as a garment of the mind,
and to have theconditions of a garment. For it ought to be madein fassfion,
it ought not to be too curious ,- it ought to be ffiaped so as to set forth any
good making of the mind, and hide any deformity 3 and above all, it ought
not to be too straight, or restrained for exercise or motion. But this part of
civil knowledge hath been elegantly immed, and therefore 1 cannot report
it for deficient. ’ ⁴ ,

ΤΗ Ε wisdom touching negotiation or bufiness harh not been hitherto
collected into writing‚ to the great derogation of learning, and the profess‘ors
of learning. For from this root springeth chiefly that note or opinion,
which by us is expres—sed in adage to this effe& ,- that there is no great con-
cuti-cuce between learning and wisdom. For of the three wisdorns Which
we have set down to pertain to civil life, for wisdom of behaviour‚ it is by
learned men for the most part despffed, as an inferior to virtue, and an enemy
to meditation3 for wisdom of government‚ they aequit themselves well
when they are called to it, but that happeneth to few: But for the wis-
dom of bufiuess, wherein man's life is most conversam, there be no books
of it, except some few scattered advertisements, that have no proportion to
the magnitude of this subjeet. For if books were written of this, as the
other, 1 doubt not but learned men with mean experience, would far excel

bum of longexpetienee, without learning, and outshoot them in their own
ow. .
