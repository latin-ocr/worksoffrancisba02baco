OF THE ADVANCErxiE-N's Bel-22⁷1.

as it appeareth that poesy serveth and conferreth to nmgnxninzity,221<)2·.11ir}·,
and to deletlation. And therefore it was exer thought to ‘have some partiei-
pation of divineness, because it doth mise and erect the mind, by lizbsnirring
the shews of things to the desires os the mind3 whereas resson dorh init-kle-
and bow the mind unto the hature of things.

A N D we see, that by these insinuations and congr-uities with mans nature
and pleasure, joined also with the agreement and consprt it harh with inu·
fick, it harh had aecess and estimation in rude times and barini-0215 regions,-
where other learning stood excluded. y

THE divilion of poesy, which is aptest in the propriety thereos (besides
those divisions which are common unto it with history ς as reigned ehronicleq,
seigned lives, and the appendices of history, as feigned epistles, reigned oru-
tions, and the rest,) is into poesy, narrations, representative and allufive.
The narrative is a mere imitation of history with the cxccss'cs before remema
ber'd, chufing for subject commonly wars and lore ,- rarely stite, and some-
times pleasure or mirth.

R E 1² R E s E N TAT 1 v E is as a visible history, and is an image of iustioris as if
they were present, as history is of aCtions in nature as they ure, that is, past:
allufive or parabolical, is a narration applied only to express lime special pu r-
pose or coneeit: Which later kind ofparabolical wistlom was much more in
use in the ancient times, as by the sables of AEfhp, and the brief sentences
of the seven, and the use of hieroglyphicks may appear.

AND the cause was for that then of necessity, to express any point of
reason which was more sharp or subtile than the vulgar in that manner, be-
cause men in those times wanted both variety of examplCS, and subtilty of
conceit : and as hieroglyphicks were before letters, so parables were before
arguments. And nevertheless now, and at all times, they do retain much
life and vigour, because reason cannot be so sensiblc, nor examples so
fit.

Bur there remaineth yet another use of poesy parabolical‚ opposite to
that which we last mentioned : for that tendeth to demonstrate and illustrate
that which is taught or delivered, and this other to retire and obscure it: thar
is, when the secrets and mysteries of religion, policy, or philosophy, are in-
volved in fables and patables.

O F this in divine poesy, we see the use is authorized. In heathen poesy,
we see the exposition of fables doth fall out sometimes with great felicity, as
in the fable that the giants being overthrown in their war against the gods,
the earth their mother, in revenge thereof brought forth Fame :

Illam terra parens ira irritata deorum,
Extremam, ut perhibent, Coeo Enceladoque sbrorem Progenm't.

Expounded that when princes and monarchics have suppreffed ac‘lual and
open rebels, then the malignity of people (which is the mother of rebellion)
doth bring forth libels and ssanders, and taxations of the stateS‚ which is of
the same kind with rebellion, but more feminine. So in the fable, that the
rest of the gods having conspired to bind Jupiter, Pallas called Bri-‘areas
with his hundred hands to his aid, expounded, that monarchies need not
fear any curbing of their absoluteness by mighty subjeets, as long as by wis-
dom they keep the hearts of the people‚ who will be sure to come in on
their fide. So in the fable, that Achilles was brought up under Chiron the

Centaure, who was. part a man and part a beast‚ expounded ingenioupy,
