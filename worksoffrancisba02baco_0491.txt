patently detcacd and conviCted of nntruth, that man's knowledge be not
weakencd nor imbased by such dross and vanity.

As for the doubts or uon liquets general or in total, 1 understand those
differences of opinions touching the principles of nature, and the fundamen-
tal points of the same, which have caused the divcrfity 0116615, schools, and
philosophies, as that of Empedocles, Pythagoras, Democritus, Parmenides,
and the rest. For although Aristotle, as though he had been of the tace
of the Ottomans, thought he could not reign, except the first thing he did
he killed all his brethtcn; yet to those that seek 1111111 311111101 magistraIsty,
it cannot but seem a matter of great profit, to sce before them the several
opinions touching the foundations of nature, not for any exact truth that
can be expee‘tcd in those theories: For as the same phaenomena in astrono-
my ate satisfied by the received astronomy of diurnal motion, and the pro-
per motions of the planets, with their ecccntricks and epicycles; and likewise
by the theory of Copcrnicus‚ who supposed the earth to move, and the cal-
culations are indifferently agreeable 10 both: so the ordinary face and view
of experience is many times satisfied by several theories and philosophies,
- whereas to find the real truth requireth another manner of severity and 31-
161111011. For, as Aristotle saith, that children at the first will 6311 every wo-
man mother, but asrerward they come 10 distinguilh according to truth:
So experienee, if it be in childhood, will call every philosophy mother,
bnt when it 601116111 10 ripcnesS‚ it will discern the true mother: so as in
the mean time 11 is good to see the several gloss'es and opinions upon na-
ture, whereof it may be every one in some one point 113111 scen clearer than
his sellows3 therefore I wish some collection to be 1113116 painsully and nn- De antiqui:

1113111611110 us of them: which kind of work I find deficient. But here Ι
must give warning, that it be done dissinffly and sevcrally, the philoso-
phies os every one throughout by themselves, and not by titles packed and
fagottcd up together, as 113111 bccn done by Plutarch. For it is the har-
nwny os a philosophy in it self, which giveth it light and credence; where-
as if it be fingled and broken, it will seem more foreign 31161 dissonant. For
as when 1 read in Tacitus the affions of Nero or Claudius, with circumstan-
ces of times, inducements and 0663110115, I find them not so strange3 bnt
when 1 read 1116111 111 Suetonius Tranquillus, gathered into titles and bundles,
and not in order of time, they seem more monstrous and incrediblc; so is
it of any philosophy reported entire, and dismembred by articles. N either
do 1 exclude opinions of later times to be likewise represented in this ka-
lendar of scits of philosophy, as that of Theophrastus Paracelfits, eloquently
reduced into an harmony, by the pen of Severinus the Daue, and that of
Tilefius, and his scholar Domus, being asa pastor-alpliilosophy, full of sense,
but of no great depth: And that of Fracastorl'us, who though he pretended
not to make any new philosophy, yet did nse the absoluteness of his own
sense upon the old: And that of Gilbertus, onr countryman, who revived
With some alterations and demonstrations the opinions of Xenophanes, and
many other worthy to be admitted.
