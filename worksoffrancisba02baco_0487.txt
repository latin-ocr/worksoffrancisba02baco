lids are for a quiekset and fcnce about the sight3 or, that the firmness ofthe
skins and hides of lixing creatuies is to defend them from the extremitics ot
hcat or eold3 or, that the bones are for the columns or beanis, whercup m
the frame of the bodies ofliving ⁷·cteatures are built; or, that the leues or
trees ate for the protccuno of the fruit; or, that the cl⁷ouds arc for w tter-

·ing of the carth3 or, that the iolidnels of the carth is for the station and

mansion ofliving creatures, and the like is κκ cll inquircd and coh 'celeri in
metaphysick, but 1n physici< they are impertinent Nay, they are indeed
but remora's and hindemnces to stay and ssug the ship from farther sailing,
and have brought this to pass, that the search of the physical causes hath
been neglected, and paffed in silence.-

AND therefore the natural philosophy of Democritus, and some others,
who did. not suppose a mind or reason in the frame of things, but attributed
the form thereos able to maintain it self to infinite essays or proofs of na-
tute, which they term fortune3 scemcth to me (as far as I can judge by the
recital and fragments which remain unto us) in particularities of physieal
causes more real and better inquired than that of Aristotle and Plato ‚- whereof

’ both intermingled final causes, the one as a part of theology, and the other is

a part oflogick, which were the favourite studies respectively of both those
persons. N ot because those final causes are not true, and worthy to be inquired,
being kept within their own provincc3 but because their excurfions into the
l'imits of phyfieal causes, hath brcd a vastness and solitude in that tract.
For otherwise keeping their precincts ancl bor-ders, men are extrcn ely de-
ceived if they think there is an enniity or repuonancy at all between them
For the cause render' d, that the hairs about the eye· lids are for the safe-
guard ot the sight, (loth not impugn the cause renderffld that pilos ty<
is incident to orisiees of molsture3 Nlnsivfifontes, &a Nor the cause ren-
der'd, that the firmners of hides' is for the armour of the body, against ex-
tremitics of heat or cold3 <loth not impugn the cause render'd, that con-
traftion of porcs is incidenttto the outwatdest parts, in regard of their ad-
jacence to foreign or unlike bodies3 and so of the rest3 both causes being
true and compatiblc, the one declaring an intention, the other a conse-
quence only.-

N EI THE R doth this call in question, or der'ogate from divine providence,
but highly confirm and exalt it. For as in civil actions he is the greater
and deeper politician, that can make other men the instruments of his will
and ends, and yet never acquaint them with his purpose3 so as they shall
do it, and yet not know what they do, than he that imparteth his meaning
to those he employeth: So is the wisdom of God more admirable, when
nature intendeth one thing, and providenee draweth forth another; than if
he had communicated to particular creatures ancl motions‚ the charac-
ters and impress'ions of his providence3 ancl thus much for metaphysick5
the later part whereof 1 allow as extant, but wilh it confined to its proper
place.

Nssv ERTHELESS there remaineth yet another part of natural philosophy,
which is commonly maele a principal part, and holdeth rank with physici<
special, and metaphys ck which is mathematick3 but Ι think it more a-
greeable to the nature of things, and to the light of order, to place it as a
branch of inetaphyfick: For the subject of it being aquantity, not quantity
indefinite3 which is but a relative, and belongeth to philosophia prima, (as
harh been said) but quantity determined‚ or proportionable,1t appear-eth
