THE persons are thelord chancellor of England, and the now bishopvof
Landaffi being then no bishop, but doctor Field.

THE incomparable good parts of the lord chancellor were highly com-
mended, his place he holds magnified‚ from whence bounty, justice and
mercy were to be distributed to the subje&5‚ with which he was solely
trusted, whither all great causes were drawn, and from whence no appeal
lay for any injustice or wrong done, save to the parliament.

mitted by him in this eminent place, whereof two cases were alleged z

THE one concerning Chrzstopher Awbrey, and the other concerning Ed-
ward Egerton. In the cause depending in the chancery between this Awbrejr
and su· William Brmker, Awbrqy feeling some hard measure, was advised
to give the lord chancellor 100 l. the which he delivered to his councel
fir George Hastings, and he to the lord chancellor3 this bufiness proceed-
ing ssowly notwithstanding, Awbrey did write divers letters, and delivered
them to the lord chancessor, but could never have any answer from his
lordship3 but at last delivering another letter, his lordffiip answered, if he
importuned him he would lay him by the hccls.
