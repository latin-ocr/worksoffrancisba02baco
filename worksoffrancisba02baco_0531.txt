to compare the people to the sea, and the orators to the winds ,- because
as the sea would of it sclf be calm and quiet, if ¹the winds did not move'
and trouble it, so the people would be peaeeable and tractablc if the sedi-
tious orators did not l'et them in working and agitation. So it mav be
fitly said, that the mind in the nature thereof would be temperate and stav'd,
if the affections as winds did not put it into tumult and perturbation.
And here again I find strange as before, that Arssotle should have written
divers volumes of ethicks, and never handled the affcctions, which is the
principal subjest thereof3 and yet in his rhetoricks, where they are con-
fidered but collaterally, and in a second degree, (as they may be moved
by speech) he finds place fot them, and handleth them well for the quantity 5
but where their true place is, he pretermitt‘cth them} For it is not his dispu—
tations about pleasure and pain that can satisfy this inquiry, no more than
he that ⁴should generally handle the nature of light, can be said to handle
the nature of colours; for pleasure and pain are to the particular affefflons,
as light is to particular colours. Better travels lsuppose had the Stoicks
taken in this argument, as far as 1 can gather by that which we have at
second hand. But yet it is like it was after their manner rather in subtility
of definitions, (which in a subject of this nature are but curiosities) than in
'afflve and ample descriptions and observations ; so likewife I find some par-
ticular writings of an elegant nature, touching some of the affections;
as of anger, of comfort upon adverse accidents, of tenderness, of counte-
nance, and other. But the poets and writers of histories are the best doctors
'of this knowledge, where we may find painted forth with great life, -how
affections are kindled and incited; and how pacified and refrained3 and
how again contained from aet, and fatther degrec3 how they disclose
themselves how they work ς how they vary ,ε how they gather and fortify3
ho'w they are lnwtapped one within another3 and how they do fight and
encounter one with another ,ς and other the like particularities. Amongst
the which, this ·last is of special use in moral and civil matters: How, Ι
say, to sct affection against affection, and to master one by another, even as
we use to hunt beast with beast, and fly bird with bird, which otherwise
percase we could not so easily recover : upon which foundation is creeted

Α that excellent use of praemium and poena, whereby civil states confist, em-

ploying the predominant affeffions of fear and ho c, for the suppreffing and
bridling the rest. For as in the government of 1 ates, it is sometimes ne-
'cess'ary to bridlc one fastion with another, so it is in the government
“within

N ow come we to those points which are within our own command,
and have force and operation upon the mind, to affe& the will and appe·
rite, and to alter manners: wherein they ought to *have handled Custom3
‘exet-eise, habit, education, example, imitation, emulation, company, fiielids‘,
praise, reproof, exhortation, fame, laws, books, studies3 these, as they have
determinate usein moralities, for from these the mind suffereth, and of
¹these are such receipts and regiments compoun'ded and described, as may
serve to recover or preserve the health and good estate of the mind, as fat
ds pertaineth to human medicine; of which number we will inlist upon
'some one or two, as an example of the rest, because it were too long
to prosecute all 3 and therefore we do resume custom and habit to speak
of.

THE opinion of Aristotle seemeth to me a negligent opinion, that of
