PROCEEDINGS ΙΝ PARLIAMENT

viz. Ἱ 116 twenty fourth, there being a reference from his majcsty to 1113
lordlhip of abufiness between the grocers and the apothecaries, the lord
chancellor received ofthe grocers 200 l. The twenty fifth article, in the
lame cause, 116 received of the apothecaries, that stood with the groccls, a
taster ofgold worth between 400 and 500 l. and a present of ambergreace.
And the twenty fixth article, he receivcd'of¹a new company of apothe-
caries, that stood against the grocers, 100 l.

To these Ι confess and declare, that the several sums from the three
parties were received3 and for that it was no judicial business, but a con-
cord of composition between the parties: and that 351 thought all-had
received goo'd, and they were all three common purseS‚ ,Ι thought it the
less matter to receive that which they voluntarily presented3 for if 1 had
taken it in the nature of a corrupt bribe, Ι knew it could not be concealed‚
because it mustneeds 06 put to account to the three several companies.

To the twenty sevcnth 11111616 of the charge, viz. he took of the French
merchants 1000 l. to constrain the vintners of London to take from thern
1 500 tuns of wine3 to aecomplish which, 116 used very 1111111661 means, by
colour of his office and authority, without bill or suit depending, terrisy-
ing the vintners by 11116315, and by imprisonments of their persons, to buy
wines whercof they had no need, nor use, at higher rates than they were
vendible.

Ι 110 confess and declar-e, that fir Thomas Smjth did deal with me in be-
half of the French company3 informing me, that the vintners by 600101,-
nation would not take off their wines 31 any reasonable prices; that it would
destroy their trade, and stay their voyage for that year3 and that ir was a
fair business, and concerned the state; and he doubted not butI 111011111
receive thanks from the king, and honour by it ,- and that they would
gratifie me with a thousand pounds for my travail in it: whereuponl ,
treated between them by way of persuafion3 and to prevent any compul—
sory suit, propounding such a price as the vintners might be gainers.6l·.
10 3 tun, as it was then maintained unto me. And after the merchants
petitioning to the king, and his majesty recommending this business unto
1116, 35 3 business that concerns his customs and the navy, Idealt 10016631-
0611111 3061 pereinptorily in it 3 and, 351 think, restrained in the mefl'engers‘
hand for a day or two some that were the most stiff; and afterwards the
merchants presented ine with 1000 l. out of their common purse, and
acknowledging themselves that Ι 11311 kept thern from a kind of ruin, and
11111 maintaining to 016, 11131 1116 1110111615, if they were not insatiably
minded, had 3 very competent gain: this is the merits of the cause,- as it
there appears tome.

To the twenty eighth article of the charge, viz. the lord chancellor hath
given way to great exaffions by his servants, both in respect of private scals,
and otherwise for sealing of injunctions :

· I‘ consessit was a great fault of neglect in me 111311100κ611 no better to
my servants. .

Tn 15 declaration I have made to your Iordffiip8‚ with a fincere mind,
humbly craving that if there should be any mistakc, your lordships would
impure it to want of memor-y, and⁴ not to any desire of mine to obscure
truth, or palliare any thing3 for I do now again confess, that in the points
charged upon mc, though they should be taken, as myself have declared
them, there is·a great deal of corruption and negleet, for which I am
hear-tisy sorry, ‚and submit my self to the judgment, graec, and mercy of the
court. γ. Fon
