Bookn. OF LEARNING.

F 1 Rs ’1- therefore' m this, as in all things which are 9111811031, we ought to
cast up our account, what 15111 0111 power, and what not for the one may be
dealt with by way of alteration, but the other by way of application only.
The husbandman cannot command, neither the nature of thc carth, nor
the seasons of the weather‚ no more 0311 the phys 01311 the constitution of the
patient, nor the variety of accidents. So 111 the culture and cure of 1110
mind of man, two things ate without our command, points of 1111111ῃο and
points of fortune: for to the bas s of the one, and the conditions of the
other, our work 15 11111110(1 311(1110(1. In these things therefore, it is left 111110
115 10 proceed by application· ‚

Vincenda est omnis fortuna firendo .·‘
and so likeWise,

Vincenda est omnis· natura florendo.

Bur when that we speak of suffering, we do not speak of a dull and
neglected suffering, but of a wisc and industrious suffering, which draweth
and contriveth use and advantage out of that which seemeth adverse and.
contrary, which is that properly which we call accommodating or apply-
ing. Now the wisdom of application rcstcth principally in the exact and
'distinct knowledge of the precedent state or disposition, untowhich we
do apply ,· for we cannot fit 3 garment, except we first take measure of the
body.

S 0 then the first article of this knowledge 15 to set down sound and true
distributions and descriptions of the several charaeters and tempers of mens
natures and dilpofitions, specially having regatd to those differences which are
most radical in being the fountains and causes of the rest, or most frequentin
concurrence or commixturc5 wherein it is not the handling of a few of
them in passage, the better to describe the mediocrities of 111111105, that 0311
satisfy this intention: fot if 11 deserve to be confidered, that there are minds
which are proportioned to great matters, and others to small, (which Ari-
stotle handleth, 01· ought to hav e handled by the name of magnanimity) doth
it not deserve as well to be considered, that there are minds proportioned to'
intend many matters, and others to few? So that some 0311 divide themselves,
others can pei-chance do exactly well, but it must be but 111 few things at
0110ος and 10 there cometh to be a 11311 01111015 of mind, as well as a pusilla-
nimity. And again, That some minds are proportioned to that which may
be diipatchcd at 01100, or within 3 short return of time· ‚ others to that which
begins afar off, andis 10 be won with length of pursuit,

So that there may be fitly said to be a longanimity‚ 1111101115 commonly niso
ascribed to God, as a 1113 gnanimity. So farther delervcd it to bc confider-
