OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookl.

As for “sulm Caesar, the exeelleney of his learning needeth not robe
argued from his education, or his company, 01· his lpeeches: but 111 3 farther
degree doth declarc it sclf in his writings and worksz whercof tome are ex-
tant and permanent, and some unfortunately perillied. Por rii-ll we see
there is left nnto ns that excellent history of his own wars which he 011-
titlcd only a commentary‚ whcrein 311 succeeding times haye admired the
solid weight of matter, :ind the real paflagCS, and lively i‘mages ot' actions
and persons expresscd in the greatest propriety of words and perspicuity of
nni-ration that ever was3 which that it was not the effect of a natural gift,
but of learning and precept, is well witneffed by that work of his, entitled,
{De Αηιιίοςξιὶα,μ being agrammatical philosophy, wherein he d'rd labour to
make this same vox ad placitum, to become vox ad licitum: and to te-
duce eustom of speech to congruity of speech, and took as it were the pic-
ture of words from the life of reason.

S o we receive from him as a monument, both of his power and learning,
the then reformed eomputation of the year, well expressing‚ that he took it
to be as great a glory to himself to observe and know the law of the hea-
νο115, as to give law to men upon the earth.

S o likewise in that book of his Anticato, it may easily appear that he did
aspire as well to victory of wit, as victory of war3 undertaking therein a
conflitst against the greatest champion with the pen that then lived, Cicero
the orator.

S 0 again in his book of Apophthegms which he collected, we see that he
esteemed it more honour to make himself but a pair of rables, to take the
wife and pithy words of others, than to have every word of his own to be
made 311 apophthegm, or 311 013010 ‚· as vain princes, by eustom of flattery,
pretend to do. And yet if Ilhould enumerate divers of his speeches‚ as 1
did those of Alexander ,- they are truly such as Salomon noteth, when he saith,
Verba sapientum tanquam aculei, &tanquam clavi in altum defixi: where-
of I will only recite three, not so (1010613010 for elegancy, but admirable for
vigour and efficacy.

A s first, it is reason he be thought a master of words, that could with one
word appease a mutiny in his army, which was thus ε The Romam, when
their generals did speak to their army, did use the word milites ‚- but when the
magistrates spake to the people, they did use the word Quirites. The sol-
diers were in tumult, and seditioussy prayed to be calhiered3 not that they
so meant, but by expostulation thereof, to draw Caesar to other conditions;
wherein he being resolute, not to give way, after some filencc, he began his
speech: Ego, Qtirites, which did admit them already cashiered3 wherewith
they were so surprized, croffed, and confused, as they would not suffer him
to go on in his speech, but relinquished their demands, and made it their suit,
to be again called by the name of milites.

T H E second speech was thus : Caesar did extremely affe& the name of
king 3 and some were set on as he pass'ed by, in popular acclamation to sa·
lute him king: whereupon finding the cry weak and poor, he put it off
thus, 111 a kind of jest, as if they had mistaken his stu-name3 Non rex sitm,
fi’d Caesam a speech, that if it be searched, the life and fulness of it ean
scaree bc expreffed: for first it was a refusal of the name, but yet not se-
rious: Again‚ it did fignify an infinite confidence and magnanimity‚ as if
he presumcd Caestzr was the greater title, as ,by his worthiness it is come to
pass till this day 5 but chiefly, it was a speech of great allurement toward

his
