ANo T H E R error is in the manner of the tradition and delivery of know-
ledgc, which 15 for the most part magistral and peremptory,· and not inge«
nuous and faithful, in a sort, as may he soonest believed, and not cafiliest exa-
mined. It is true, that in compendious 110311Γο5 for praehet· that form 15 not

« Socrates's ironieal doubting ofall things, but 10 propound things sincerely>

with more 01· less ass'everation, as they stand in a man’s own judgment proved
more or less.

OTHER errors there are in the scope that men 111-0110111111 10 themselves,
whereunto they bend their endeavours: sor whereas the more constant and
devote kind of 111-01011015 of any science ought to propound to themselves to
make some additions to their seicnee5 they convert their labours to aspire
to certain second prizes 3 as to 110 3 profound interpreter, or commentator 3
to be 3 lharp champion ot defender3 to be a methodieal compounder or
abridger ς and so the patrimony of knowledge cometh to bc sometimes im-
proved, but seldom augmented.

B U T the greatest error of all the rest, is the mistaking or misplacing os the
last or farthest end of knowledge: for men have enter'd into a delire of learn-
ing and knowledge, sometimes upon a natural curiosity, and inquisitis-e ap-
petite3 sometimes to entertain their minds with variety and delight3 some-
times for ornament and reputati0n3 and sometimes to enable them to victory
of wit and contradiffi0n3 and most times for lucre and profeffion; and

seldom fincerely to give a true account of their gift of reason, to the benefic>

and use of men 1 35 if there were fought in knowledge a¹ couch, whereupon
to rest a searching and restless spirit, or a terras for a wandering and variable
mind, to walk up and down with a fair prospcc‘t3 or a tower of state for a
proud mind to raise itself upon ς 01 a fort or commanding ground for
strife and contention ,· or 3 shop for profit or sale ‚- and not a rich stote-house
for the glory of the Creator, and the relief of man’s estate. But this is that
which will indeed dignify and exalt knowledge, if contemplation and action
may be more nearly and straightly conjoined and united together than they
have been ; 3 000101101100 like unto that of the two highest planem, Saturn,
the planet of rest and contemplati0n3 and Jupiter, the planet of civil so-
ciety and astion. Howbeit, I do not mean when 1 speak of use and action,
that end before-mentioned of the applying of knowledge to lucre and pro-
feff10n3 fot-I arn not ignorant how much that diverteth and interruptcth the
prosecution and advancemcnt of knowledge ,- like unto the golden ball
thrown before Atalanta, which while 1110 goeth afide and stoopeth to take
up, the tace is hinder'd.
