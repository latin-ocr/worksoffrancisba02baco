AGALNST THE LoRDoHANcELLOR.

Fon extenuation Ι will use none concerning the matters themselves;
only it may plcasc your lordship5‚ out of your nobleness, to cast your eves
of compaffion upon my person and estate. l-was never noted for any
avaritious mam and the apostlc saith, that co-vetousheſs is the root of all
evil. Ihope also that your lordlhips do the rather find me in the flate of
grace3 for that in all these particulars there are few or none that are not
almost two years old; whereas those that have an habit of corruption do
commonly wax worse: so -that it harh pleased God to prepare me by pre-
cedcnt degrees of amendment to my present penitency3 and for my estate,
it. is so mean and poor, . as my care is now chiefly to satisfy my dcbts,

AND so fearing I have troublcd your lordships too long, I shall conclude
with an humble suit unto you, that if your lordssiips procccd to sentence,-
your sentence may not be heavy to my ruin, but gracious and mjxt with
mercy; and not only so, but that you would be noble intereessbrs for me
to' liis majesty likewise for his grace and favour,

Your lordsht'ps humble servant and fitppliant,
Francis St. Albanis, Canc.'

ingenuous and full confessiom and demanded of him, whether it be his
vown hand that is subscribed to the same, and whether he will stand to it
or no; unto which the said. iord chauccllor answered, viz. my lords, it is
my aet, my hand, my heart; Ι beseech your lordlhips to be merciful to
a broken reed. The which answer being reported to the house, it was a·
greed by the house, to move his majesty to sequester the sea13 and the
lordsintreated the prince's highness‚ that he would be pleased to move the
king, whereunto his highness condescended3 and the same lords which
went to take the acknowledgement of the lord chancellor's hand, were ap-
pointed to attend the prince to the king, with some other lords added;
and his majesty did not only sequester the seal, but awarded a new corn·
miffion unto the lord chief justice to execute the place of the chancellot
or lord kee er.

PARLIEMENT. dat. primo Maii, and on wednesday the second of May
the said commiffion being read, their lordfhips agreed to proceed to sen-
tence the iord chanceilor to-morrow morning3 wherefore the gentleman
ulher, and serjcant at arms, attendants on the upper house, were com-
manded to go and summon him the said lord chancellor to appear in per-

the said serjeant was commanded to take his mace with him, and to shew
it unto his lordship at the said summons: but they found him fick in bed;
and being summoned, he answered that he was fick, and protestcd that he
feigned not this for any excuse; for if he had been well he would willingly
