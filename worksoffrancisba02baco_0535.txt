BookII. OF LEARNING.

Sunt geminae sbmni portae, quarum altera fertur
Cornea, qua veris fac-ilis datar exitus umbris .-
Altera candenti persi'c‘la nitens elephanto,

Sed falfa ad coelum mittunt insbmnia manes.

So if we put on sobriety and attention, we shall find it a sure maxim in know--
ledge, that the more pleasant liquor (of wine) is the more vaporouS, and the
braver gare of ivory sendeth forth the falser dreams.

Β U T we have no'w concluded that general part of human philosophy,
which contemplateth man segregate, and as he confisteth of body and spirit.
Wherein we may farther note, that there seemeth to be a relation or confor-
mity between the good of the mind, and the good of the body. For as we
dividcd the good of the body into health, beauty, strength and pleasure, so
the good of the mind inquired in rational and moral knowledges, tendeth to
this, to make the mind found and without perturbation ,- beautiful and gra-
eed with decency; and strong ancl agile for all dutics of life: These three, as
in the body, so in the mind, seldom meet, aud commonly sever. For it is
easy to obser-ve, that many have strength of wit and eourage, but have neither
health from perturbations, nor any beauty or decency in their doings: some
again have an elegancy and fineness of carriage, which have neither soundness
of honesty, nor substance of sufficiency ε and some again have honest and re-
formed minds, that can neither become themselves, nor manage bufiness;
and sometimes two of them meet, and taiely all three. As for pleasure, we
have likewise determined, that the mind ought not to be reduced to stupid,
but to retain pleasure ,- 6011611661 rather in the subjeet of it, than in the
strength andvigout of it.

C 1V1L knowledge is eonversant about a subjest which of all others is
most immersed in matter, and hardliest reduced to axiom. Nevertheless, as
Cato the censor said, “ That the Romans were like sheep, for that a man
“ might better drive a flock of them, than one of them; for in a flock, if you
“ could get but some few go right, the rest would follow.'' So in that respe&
moral philosophy is more difficile than policy. Again, moral philosophy
propoundeth to it self the framing of internal goodness ς but civil knowledge
requireth only an external goodness ‚- for that as to society sufficeth. And
therefore it cometh oft to pass that there be evil times in good governments :
for so we find in the holy story, when the kings were good ς yet it is added,
S ed adhuc populus non direxerat cor strum ad Dominum Deum patrum fito*
rum. Again, states as great engines move ssowly, and are not so soon put out
of frame: for asin AEgypt the seven good years sustained the seven bad ,ς so
governments for a time well grounded, do bear out errors following. But
the resolution of particular persons is more suddenly subverted. These re·
speras do somewhat qualify the extreme difficulty of civil knowledge.

T H Is knowledge hath three parts, according to the three summary affions
of society, which ate, conversation, negotiation, and government. For man
seeketh in society comfort, use and protestion: and they be three wisdoms
of divers natureS, which do often sever 5 wisdom of behaviour, wisdom of
business, and wisdom of state.

Tru-2 wisdom of conversation ought not to be over much affected, but
much less despised: for it hath not only an honour in it self, but an influence
also into business and government. The poet saith,
