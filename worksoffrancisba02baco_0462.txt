And therefore we see that voluptuous men turn friars, and ambitious prim

“ It is a view of delight (saith 110) 10 stand or wall< upon the shore fide, and

of all other human desii-cs. W'e see then how far the monuments of
wit and learning are more durable than 1110 1110111111101115 of power, or of the>
hands. For have not the verses of Homer continued twenty five hundred
years, or more, without the loss of 3 syllable or letter3 during which time,
infinite pellaces, temples, castles, 011105, have been deeayed 31111 deinolished?
It is not poss'ible to have the true pietur-es or statues of C yms, Alexander,

But the images of mens wits and knowledges 101113111 111 books exempt-

cast their seeds in the minds of others, provoking and causing infinite
actions and opinions in succeeding ages z So that if the invention of the strip

how much 111010 are letters to be magnified 3 which 35 ships pass through the
vast seas of time, and make ages so distant to participate of the wis-
dom, illuminations and inventions, the one of the other? Nay fartherwe
see, some of the philosophers which were least divine, and most im-

yet 031110 to this point, that whatsoever motions the spirit of 111311 0011111 ast
