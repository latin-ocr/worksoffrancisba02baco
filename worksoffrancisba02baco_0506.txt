inquiry in every particular knowledge, as things of great nst, being- mix-
tures oflogick with the matter of scient-cs: for in these it lioldetli, Ars in·-
veniendi adolescit cum inventis ,- for as in going of a way, we tio not oni y
gain that part of the way which is parieti, but we gain the better sight of
that part of the way which remainctlu so every degree osprocceding in a
scicnce giveth a light to that which followeth, which light if wc strengthen‚
by drawing it forth into questions or places of inquii-y, we do greatly ad-
vance our pursuit.

Now we pass unto the arts of judgmenr, which handle the natures of
proofs and demonstrations‚ which as to indnffion harh a coincidence with
invention: for in all inmenens, whether in good or vicious form, the same
affion of the mind which inventeth‚ judgeth all one as in the sense, but o-
therwise it isin proof by syllogism3 for the Proof being not immediate but
by mean, the invention of the mean is one thing, and the judgment of the
consequence is another; the one exciring only, the other examining.
Therefore for the real and exa& form of judgment‚ wc refer our serves to
that which we have spoken of interpretation of nature.

Fon the other judgment by syllogismi, as it is a thing most agreeable to
the mind of man, so it harh been vehemently and excellently laboured3 for
the nature of man doth extremely cover to have somewhat in his under-
standing fixed and unmoveable, and as a rest and support of the mind.
And therefore as Aristotle endeavoureth to prove, that in all motion there
is some point quiescent3 and as he elegantly expoundeth the ancient fable
of Atlas, (that stood fixed, and bare up the heaven from falling) to be
meant of the· poles or axle-tree of heaven, whereupon the converfion is ac-
complisheds so affuredly men have a desire to have an Atlas or axle-tree
within, to keep them from fluctuation‚ which is like toa perpetual peril
of falling; therefore men did hasten to set down some principles about which
the variety of their disputations might turn.

So then this art of judgment is but the reduffion of propositions to
principles in a middle term. The principles to be agreed by all, and ex·
empted from argument: the middle term to be eleosted at the liberty of e-
very man's invention: the redustion to be of two kinds, dite& and inver-
ted3 the one when the proposition is reduced to the principle, which
they term a probation ostensive3 the other, when the contradie‘tory of
the proposition is reduced to the contradi&ory of the principle, which is,
that which they call per incommodum, or preffing an absurdity; the num-
ber or middle terms to be as the proposition standeth‚ degrees more ot less
removed from the principle.

Bur this art hath two several methocls of doctrine, the one by way of
direffion, the other by way of caution3 the former frameth and setteth
down a true form of consequence, by the variations and deflexions from
which errors and inconsequences may be exaffly judged. Toward the com-
position and struChaoe of which form it is incident to handle the parts
thereofi which are propositionS, and the parts of propositions which ate
simple Wordss and this is that part of logick which is comprehended in the
analyticks.

THE second method of dodrine was introduced for expedite use and as-
surance sake, discovering the more subtile forms of sophisms and illaquea-
nous, withtheir redargutions‚ whichis thatwhichistermed Elenches. For
although in the more gross sorts of fallacies it happeneth, (as Seneca ma·-
keth the comparison well) as in jugling scats, which though we knowhnot
