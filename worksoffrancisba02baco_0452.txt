Thus 'much 'therefore for divine testimony and evidence, concerning the
true dignity and value of learning.

As for human proofs, it is so large a field, as in a discourse of this na-
tur-e a-nd brev-ity, it is fit rather to use choice of those things, which we
ssaallp'roduce, than to cmbrace the variety of them. First therefore in the
degrees of human honour amongst the heathen, it was the highest to obtain
toa veneration and adoration as a God. This unto the Christians is as
the forbidden fruit. But we spcak now separatcly of human testimony;
according to which, that which the Grecmns call Apotheqffs‚ and the Latius,
relatio inter divos, was the supreme honour which man could attribute un—
vto man, especially when it was given not by a formal decrce or a& of state,
as it was used amongst the Roman emperors; but by an inward afl'ent and
belief, which honour being so high, ancl also a degree or middle term:
for there were reckon'd above human honours, honour heroical and divine ‚-
in the attribution and distribution of which honours, We see antiquity
made this difference: that whereas founders and uniters of states and ci-
ties, lawgivers, extirpers of tyrants, fathers of the people‚ and other emi-
nent persons in civil merit, were honoured but with the titlcs of worthies
or demy—gods; such as were Hercules, Thesbm, Minos, Romulus, and the
like: on the other side, such as were inventors and authors of new arts,
cndowmcnts, and commodities towards man's life, were ever consecrated a-
mongst the gods themselves ‚ asewas Ceres, Bacchus, Μεναινέιις, Apollo, and
others, and justly: for the merit of the former is confined within the circle
of an age or a nati0n3 and-is like fruitful ihowers, which though they be
profitable and good, yct serve but for that season, and for a latitude of ground
where they fall: but the other is indeedlike the benefits of heaven, which
are permanent and universal. The former again is mix'd with strife and
perturbation‚ but the latter harh the true character of divine presence, com-
ing in aura leni, without noise or agitation.

N Ε 1T H ER is certainly that other merit of learning, in repreffing the in-
conveniencies which grow from man to 111a11,}111ucli inferiorssto the former, of
relieving the neceffities which arise from nature3 which merit was lively set
forth by the ancients in that feigned relation of Orpheus’s theme, where all
beasts and birds affcmblcd ‚- and forgetting their several appetites, some of
prey, some of game, some of quari-el, stood all sociably together, listening
nuto the airs and aecords of the harp ,- the sound whereof no sooner ceased,
or was drowned by some louder noise, but every beast returned to his own
nature; wherein is aptly described the nature and condition of men, who arc
full of savage and unreclaimed defires of profit, of lust, of revenge ,- which
as long as they give ear to precepts, to laws, to religion, sweetly touched
with eloquencc and persuafion of books, of sermons, of harangues, so
long is society and peace maintained: but if these instruments be filent,
or that sedition and tumult make them not audible, all things diffolve
into anatehy and confusion.

BUT this appeareth more manifestly‚ when kings themselves, or persons
of authority under them, or other governours in eommonwcalths and po—
pular estates, are endued with learning. For although he might be thought
partial to his own profession, that said, “ Then should people and estates be
“ happy, when either kings were philosophers, or philosophers kings ,- '⁶
yet so much is verified by expericnee‚ that under wisc and learned princes
and governourS, there have been ever the best times ,- for howsoever kings

may have their imperfections in their passions and customs 5 yet if they be
