'OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookl.

1 ANOTHER fault likewise much of this kind hath been incident to learn-
ed mens which is, that they have cstcemed the preservation, good, and
honour of their countries or masters, before their own fortunes or lateties.
Por so saith Demosthenes unto the Athenianss “ 1f it please you to note it,
“ my counsels unto you are not such, whereby I should grow great amongst
“ you, and you become little amongst the Grecians: but they be of that
“ nature, as they are iomannes not good for me to give, but are always
g‘ood for you to follow.'' And so Seneca, after he had consecrated that
Qtinquennium Neronis to the eternal glory of learned governoui·5‚ held on
his honest and loyal course of good and free counsel‚ after his master grew
extremely corrupt in his government: neither can this point otherwise be;
for learning endueth mens minds with a true sense of the frailty of their
persons, the casualty of their forrunes, and the dignity of their soul and vo-
cation: so tha't it is impossible for them to esteem that any greatness of
their own fortune can be a true or worthy end of their being and ordain-
ment, and therefore are defirous to give their account to God, and so like-
wise ro their masters under God, (as kings and the states that they serve)
inthesewords3 Ecce tibi lucrefhci, and notecce mihi lacrefeci: whereasthe
corrupter sort of mere politieians, that have not their thoughts established by
learning in the love and apprehension of duty, nor ever look abroad into
universality, do refer all things to themselves, and thrust themselves into
the centre of the world, as if all lines lhould meet in them and their for-
tune83 never cai-ing in all tempests what becomes of the ship of states, so
they may save themselves in the coekboat of their own fortune5 whereas
men that feel the weight of duty, and know the limits of self-love, use to
make good their places and danes, though with peril. And if they stand
in seditious and violent alterations, it is rather the reverencc which many
times both adverse parts do give to honesty, than any versatile advan-
tage of their own carriage. But for this point of tender sense, and fast obli-
gation of duty, which learning doth endue the mind withal‚ howsoever for-
tune may tax it, and many in the depth of their corrupt principles may
despise it, yet it will receive an open allowance, and therefore needs the
less disproof or excusation.

ῑ(

ANoTHER fault incident commonly to learned men, which may be more
probably defended than truly denied‚ is, that they fail sometimes in apply-
ing themselves to particular persons: which want of exa& application ari-
seth from two causes3 the one because the largeness of their mind can
hardly confine it self to dwellin the exquisite observation or examination of
the nature and customs of one persons for it is a speech for a lover, and not
for awise man: Satis magnum alter alteri theatrum sitmus. N evertheless I
lhall yield, that he that cannot contraCt the fight of his mind, as well as
disperse and dilate it, wanteth a great faculty. But there is a second cause,
which is no inability‚ but a rejection upon choice and judgment. For the
honest and just bounds of observation‚ by one person upon another, extend
no farthe'r‚ but to understand him sufficiently‚ whereby not to give him of-
fenee, or whereby to be able to give him faithful eounsel, or whereby to
stand upon reasonable guard and cantion, in respest of a man’s self. But
to be speculative into another man, to the end to know how to work him,
or wind him, or govern him, proceedeth from aheart that is double and
eloym, and not entire and ingenuous3 which as in friendship it is want
of integrity‚ so towards princes or superiors‚ is want of duty. For the cus·
tom of the Levant, which is, that subjcds do sorbeat to gaze or fix their

eyes
