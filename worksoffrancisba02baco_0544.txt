OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookll.

T HE second precept concerning this knowledge, is for men to take good
information touching their own personS, and well to understand themselves : ἱ
knowing that as St. James saith, though men look oft in a glass, yet they do
suddenly forget themselves ς ⁸wherein as the divine glass is the word of (jod,
so the politick glass is the state of the world, or times wherein we lives in
the which we are to behold our selves. ⁵

Fon men ought to take an impar-rial view of their own abilities and vir-
tues3 and again of their wants and inipedinieiit53 accounting these with the
most, and those other with the least5 and from this view and examination,
to srame the considerations following.

F 1 Rs T, to consider how the constitution of their nature sorteth with the
general state of the times3 which if they find agreeable and fit, then in all
things to give themselves more scope and liberty; but if differing and diffo-
nant, then in the whole conrse of their life to be more close, retired and re-
served: as we see in Tiberius, who was never seen at a play, and came not into
the senate in twelve of his last years ,- whereas Augustus Caefhr lived ever in
men’s eyes, which Tacitus observeth : Alia Tiberio morum via.

S ECONDLY‚ to consider how their nature sorteth with profeffions and
courses of life, and accordingly to make election if they be free ,ς and if en-
gaged, to make the departure at the first opportunity, as we see was done by
duke Valentine, that was designed by his father to a sacerdotal profeffion,
bnt quitted it soon after in regard of his parts and inclination ς being sueh
n‘evertheless, as a man cannot tell well whether they were worse for a prince
or for a priest. ‘

ΤΗ 1 R D LY, to consider how they sort with those whom they are like to
have competitors and concurrentS, and to take that course wherein there is
most solitude, and themselves like to be most eminent3 as Julius Caefizr did,
who at first was an orator or pleader3 but when 116 saw the excellency of Ci-
cero, Hortensius, Catulus, and others for eloquence, and saw there was no
man of reputation for the wars but Pompeius, upon whom the state was for-
ced to relys he forsook his course begun toward a civil and popular greatness,
and transferred his defigns to a martial greatness.

F o U R T H L Y, in the choice of their friends and dependences‚ to proceed
according to the composition of their own nature3 as we may see in Caesar,
all whose friends and. followers were nien aftive and effedffial, but not solemn,
or of reputation.

1³ 1 F T H L Y, to take special heed how they gulde themselves by examples,
in thinking they can do as they see others do3 whereas perhaps their natures
and carriages are far differing. In which error it scemeth Pompey was, of
whom Cicero saith, that he was wont often to say, Sylla potu-it, ego non po-
tero ‚2 Wherein he was much abused, the natures and proceedings of himself
and his example, being the unlikest in the world, the one being fieree, vio-
lent, and prcssing the fa& the other solemn, and full of majesty and circum-
stance3 and therefore the less effeaual. ’ ·
Β ur this precept touching the politick knowledge of our selves, hath ma-'r
ny Other branches whercupon we cannot infist- ’
Ν ex T to the well understanding and discerning of a man’s self, there fol-
lowcth the well opening and revcaling a man's sels, wherein we see nothing
more usual than for the more able man to make the less ffiew. For there
