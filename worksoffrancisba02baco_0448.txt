‘Decljnat curfizs, auremque volubile tollis.

Neither is my meaning, as was spoken of Socrates, to call philosophy down'
from heaven to converse upon the earth, that is, to leave natural philosophy
afide, andro apply knowledge only to manners and policy. But as both
heaven and carth do conspire and contribure to the use and benefit of man:
so the end ought to be from both philosopffies, to separate and 101061 vain
speculationS, and whatsoever is empty and void, and to preserve and aug-
ment whatsoever is solid and fruitful z that knowledge may not be as
a courtesan for pleasure and vanity only, or as a bondwoman to acquire
and gain to her mastcr's use, but as a sponse for generation, fruit, and
comfort.

THUS have 1 described and opencd, as by a kind of diffefflom those pec-
cant humours (the principal of 1110111) which have not only given impediment
to the proficience of learning, but have given also occasion, to the traduce-
ment thereof : wherein if 1 have been too plain, it must be remember’d ε
Fidelia vztlnera amantis, st'd dolofiz oscula mallgnantis.

TH1s Ithink I have gained, that Ι ought to be the better believed, in
that whichI shall say pertaining to commendation: because l have pro-
ceeded so freely in that which concerneth censure. And yet Ι have no
purpose to enter into a laudative of learning, or to make a hymn to the ·
Muse53 (though I am of opinion thar it is long since their rites were duly
celebratedz) but my intent is without varnilh or amplification justly to
weigh the dignity of knowledge in the balance with other things, and to
take the truc value thereos by testimonies and arguments divine and hu-
mane.

F 1 Rs T therefore, let us seek the dignity of knowledge in the archetype or
first platform‚ which is the attributes and atis of God, as far as they are re-
vealed to man, and may be obser-ved with sobriety; wlicrein we may not
seek‘it by the name of learning: for all learning is knowledge acquired‚
and all knowledge in God is original: And therefore we must look for
it by another name, that of wisdom or sapienee, as the scriptures call
11.

IT is so then, that 111 1110 work of the creation we see a double emana-
tion of virtue from God; the one referring more properly to power, the
other to wisdoms the one cxpreffcd in making the subfistence of the mat-
ter, and the other in dispofing the beauty of the form. This being supposed,
it is to be observed, that for any thing which appeareth in the history of the
creation, the confused mass and matter of heaven and earth, was made in a
moment3 and the order and dispofition of that chaos, or masS, was the
work of fix days3 such a note o'f difference it plcased God to put upon
the works of power, and the works of wisdom : XVhercwith concurreth
that in the former, it is 1101 set down that God said, Let there be heaven
and earth, as it is set down of the works following ς but actually, that God
made heaven and earth : the one carrying the style of a manufactum, and the
other of a law, dccree, or council.

To proceed to that which is next in order from God to spirits. W'e
find, as far as credit is to be given to the celestial hierarchy, of that
supposed ‘Dionystus the senator of Athens, the first place or degree is given
to the angels of love, which are termed seraphim ; the second, to the angels
of light, which are termed cherubinis and the third, and so following
placeS, to thrones, principalities, and the rest, which are all angels of
