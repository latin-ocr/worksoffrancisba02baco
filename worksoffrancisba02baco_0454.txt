OF THE ADVANCEMENT BookL

lte desired to comprehend all things, and not to reserve himself for the wor-
thiest things3 falling into the like humour that was long before noted in
‘Philip of Macedon, who when he would needs over—sule and put down an
excellent musician, in an argument touching musick, was well answered by
him again, ‘⁶ God forbid, Sir, (nith he) that your fortune ssiould be so bad,
“ as to know these things better than I.'’ It pleased God likewise to use the
curiosity of this emperor, as an inducement to the peace of his Church in
those days. For having Christ in veneration, not as a God or Saviour,
but as a wonder or novelty ,- and having his piCture in his gallery, mate-hed
with Apollonius, (with whom in his vain imagination he thought he had
some conformity,) yet it served the turn to allay the bitter hatred of those
times against the christian name, so as the church had peace during his time3
and fot his government civil, although he did not attain to that of T rajmfs,
in the glor-y of arms, or perfefflon of justice ‚- yet in deserving of the weale
of the subject, he did exceed him. For Trajan ereered many famous mo-
numents and buildings, insomueh as Constantine the Great in emulation,
was wont to call him Parietaria, wall—flower, because his name was
upon so many walls: but his buildings and works were more of glory
and triumph, than use andneeessity. But Adrion spent his whole reign,
which was peaceable, in a perambulation or stitvey of the Roman empire,
giving order and making ass'1gnati0n where he went, for re-edifying of cities,
towns and forts decay’d3 and for cutting of rivers and streams 3 and for
making bridges and passages 5 and for polishing of cities and commonalties,
with new ordinances and constitutions ,- and granting new franchises and in-
corporations3 so that his whole time was a very restauration of all the lapses
and decays of former times.
, ANronus Pius, who succeedcd him, was a prinee excellently learned ‚-
and had the patient and subtle wit of a school-mam insomuch as in common
speech (which leaves no virtue untaxed) he was called cymini fifft'or, a car-
ver, or a divider of cumin-seed, which is one of the least seeds; such a
patience he had and settled spirit, to enter into the least and most exa& dif-
ferenees of causes; afruit no doubt of the exceeding tranquillity, and se·
renity of his mind ς which being no ways charged or incumber'd, either
with fears, remorses, or scruples, but having been noted for a man of the
purest goodness, without all fifflon or affeetat'mn that hath reigned or lived,
made his mind continually present and entire. He likewise aproached a
degree nearer unto christianity, and became, as Agrippa said unto S. Paul,
Half a Christian ,- holding their religion and law in good opinion3
and not only ceafing persecution, but giving way to the advanccment
of Christiana

T H E R E suceeeded him the first Divi Fratres, the two adoptive brethren,
Lucius Commodus Verus, son to AEljus Verus, who delighted much in the
softer kind of learning, and was wont to call the poet Martial his Virgil:
and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, whereof the later, who obscured his col·
legue‚ and survived him long, was named the philosopher5 who as he
excelled all the rest in learning, so he excelled them likewise in perfeetion
of all royal virtues. Insomuch as Julianus the emperor, in his book en-
tituled‚ Caesares, being as a pasquil or satyr to deride all his predeceffors,
feigned, that they were all invitcd to a banquet of the god8‚ and Silenus
the jcstcr sate at the nether end of the table, and bestowed a scoff on every
one as they came in; but when Marcus Philosophus came in, Silenus was

gravelled and out of countenance‚ not knowing where to carp at him, save
