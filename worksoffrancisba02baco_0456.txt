“eamp throughout his journeys and eonqucsts. W hat price and estimation
he had leat-nino, in, doth notably appear in these three particulars: first, in
‘the envy he used to express, that he bore towards Arsames, in this, that he
⁴had so good a trumpet of his ‚praises as Homer's xerses: Secondly, in the
{iitignieiit 01· solution he gave touching that precious cabinet of Darius, which
was found amongst his j'ewels, whereos question was made what thing was
worthy 10 be piit into it, and he gave his opinion for Homer's works:
Thirdlv, 111 1113 letter 10 Aristotle, after he had set forth his books of nature,
whe1·eihlie expostulateth with him for publishing the secrets or mysteries of
philosophy, and gave him 10 understand that himself esseemed it more
to excel other men in learning and knowledge, than in power and 6111-
pire. And what usp he had of learning doth appear, or rather 1111116 111
all his speeches and answers, being full of science and use of seience, and
that in all variety.

ΛΝΒ 11616111 again it may seem a thing scholastical, and somewhat idle,
to reeite things that every man knoweth ,- but yet, since the argument Ι
handle, leadeth me thereunto, Ι arn glad that 111611 shall perceive I am as
willing to flatter (if they will so call it) an Alexander, 01· a Caesar, or an
Antoninus, that are dead many hundred years fince, as any that now liv-
eth: for it is the displaying of the glory of learning in sovereignty that Ι
propound to my self, and not an humour of declaiming any man’s praises.
Observe then the speech hc used of Diogenes, and see if it tend not to the
truc estate of one of the greatest questions of moral philosophy3 whether the
enjoying of outward things, or the contemning of them, be the greatest
happiness: for when he saw Diogenes so perfectly contented with so little,
he said to those that mocked at his condition 3 “ were Ι 1101 Alexander, I
'¹‘ would wilh to be Diogenes? But Seneca inverteth it, and saith‘3 Plus
erat, qnod hic nollet accipere, quam quod ille poffet dare. There were
more things which Diogenes would have refused, than those were which
Alexander could have given or enjoycd.

OBSERVE again that speech which was usual with him, “ That he felt
“ his mortality chiefly in two things, sseep and lust ;” and see if it were
not a speech extrastcd out of the depth of natural philosophy, and liker
to ha've come out of the mouth of Arzstotle, or Democritus, than from A-
lexander.

S ΕΒ again that speech of humanity and poesy 3 when upon the bleeding
of his wounds, he called 111110 him one of his flatterers, that was wont to as-
cribe to him divine honour, and said, “ Look‚ this is very blood ‘3 this is not
“ such liquor as Homer speaketh of, which ran from Venus's hand, when ¹it
“ was pierced by Diomedes.'’

S E E likewlse his readiness in reprehension of logick, 111 1116 speech he used
to Caffander, upon a complaint that was made against his father Antipater ἑ
for when Alexander happen'd to say, “ Do you think these men would have
“ 601116 from so far to complain, except they had just cause of grief ?'' And
Caffander answered, “ Yea, that was the matter, because they thought {hey
‘⁶ should not be disprovedf’ Said Alexander laughing: “ See the subtiltie's
‘⁶ of Aristone, to take a matter both wayS, pro <sy contra, &cf

BUT 11016 again how well he could use the same art, which he reptess
hended to serve his own humour, when bearing a secret grudge to Callisthe-
nes, because he was against the new ceremony of his adoration ε feasting
- one night, where the same Callisthenes was at 1116 1311165 11 wasmoved by
