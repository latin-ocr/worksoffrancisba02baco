of history is the bafis. So of natural philosophy, the bafis is natural histo-
ry5 the stage next the basis is phyfick3 the stage next the vertical point is
metaphylick. As for the vertical point, Opus quod operatur Deus aprinci-

pio usque ad finem, the summary law of nature, we know not whether
man's enquiry ean attain nnto it. But these three be the true stages of
knowledge, and are to them that are depr-med, no better than the giants

But to those which refer all things to the glory of God, they are the three
acclamati0n53 Same, ν[ἱιηὶἶῑιες sanam holy in the description, or dilatation

in the union of them in a perpetual and uniform law.

ΛΝΒ therefore the speculation was excellent in Parmenides and Plato,

least multiplicity, which appeareth to be metaphvfick‚ as that which
confidet-eth the simple forms or differenees of dunos, which are few in

number, and the degrees and co-ordinations whercof make all this var

THE second part of metaphysick is the enquiry of final causes, whiehI

phyfical enquiries, harh intercepted the severe and diligent inquiry of all
real and physical causeS‚ and given men the occasion to stay upon these sa-

Fon this I find done not only by Plato, who ever anehotcth upon that
shore, but by Aristotle, Galen, and others, which do usually likewise fall
