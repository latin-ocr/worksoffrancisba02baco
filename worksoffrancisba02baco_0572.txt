and pray judgrnent against him the lord chancellor as the nature of his
offence and demerits do require.

THE lord chief justice answered, Mr. Speaker, upon complaint of the
commons against the viscount St. Alb-an lord chancellor, this high court
hath thereby, and by his own confession, found him guilty of the crimes

,and corruptions complained of by the commons, and of sundry other
„crimes and corruptions of like nature.

and having his excuse of not attending by reason of infirmity and fickness‚
which he protestcd was not feigned, or else he would most willingly have
amended, doth nevertheless think fit to procecd to judgment3 and therc-
