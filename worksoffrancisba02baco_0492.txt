OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookn,

WE come therefore now to that knowledge whereunto the adicient ora—
clc dir-estem us, which is the knowledge of our selve53 which desen-eth the
more accurate handling, by how much it toucheth us more nearly. This
knowledge, as it is the end and term of natural philosophy in the inten—
tion of man, so notwithstanding it is but a portion of natural philosophy
in the continent of nature3 and generally let this bc a rulc, that all parti.-
tions of knowledges‚ be accepted rather for lines and veins, than fot fcffions
and separati01133 and that the continuance and cntireness of knowledge be
preserved. For the contrary hereof nath made particular sciences to be-
come barren, ssiallow, and erroneous‚ while they have not been nouriihed
and maintained from the common fountain. So we see Cicero the orator
complained of Socrates and his school, that he was the first that separated
philosophy and rhetorick, whereupon rhetorici< became an empty and vcr-
bal art. So wc may sce, that the opinion of Copernicus ronching the rota—
tion of the carth, which astronomy it self cannot correct, because it is not
repugnant to any of the phaenomena, yet natural philosophy may corre&
So we see also that the science of medicine, if it be destitute and forsaken
by natural philosophy, it is not much better than an empirica] prae'iic‘e:
with this reservation therefore we proceed to human philoiophy or huma·
nity, which hath two parts: The one confidereth man segregate or di-
stributively3 the other congregate or in society. So as human philosophy is
either simple and particular, or conjugate and civil. Humanity particular con·
fisteth of the same parts whereof, man consisteth, that is, of knowledge-‘2
which respect the body, and of knowledges that respest the mind3 but bc-
fore we distribute so far, it is good to constitute. For 1 do take the con-
fiderat-ion in general, and at large of human nature to be fit to be cananei*
pared and made a knowledge by it self5 not so much in rcgard of those de-
lightful and elegant discourses which have been made of the dignity of man,
of his miserieS, of his state and life, and the like adjuncrs of his common
and undivided nature3 but chiefly in regard of the knowledge concerning
the sympathies and concordances between the mind and body, which bc-
ing mixed, cannot be properly affigned to the sciences of either.

Tnls knowledge hath two branches: for as all lcagues and amitics con-
fist of mutual intelligence and mutual offices, so this league of mind and
body hath these two parts, ,how the one discloseth the other, and how the
one worketh upon the other, discovery-and impreflion. The former of
these hath begotten two artS, both of prediction or prenotion, whereof the
oncis honoured with the1inquiry of Aristotle, and the other of Hzppocrates.
And although they haveof later time been used to be coupled with super-
stitious and. fantastical arts, yet being purged and restored to their truc state,
they have both of them a solid ground in nature, and a profitable use in
life. The first is physiognomy, which discover-eth the disposition of the
mind by the lineaments of the body. The second is the exposition of na-
tural dreams, which discovereth the state of the body by the imaginations
of the mind. In the former of these l note a deficience‚ for Artstotle harh
very ingenioussy and diligently handled the fastui-es of the body, but not the
gestures of the body, which are no less comprehensible by art, and of
greater use and advantage. For the lineaments of the body to disclose the
disposition and inclination of the mind in general, but the motions of the
countenance and parts donor only so, but do farther disclose the present
humour and state of the mind and will„ ⁴,For as your majesty iaith most
