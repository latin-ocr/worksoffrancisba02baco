medium or syllogismi. And besides, those principles or first pofitions have
no distordance with tha-t reason, which draweth down and deduceth the
inferior positions. But yet it holdeth not in religion alone, but in many
knowledges, bozh ofgreaterand smallernaturc: namely, wherein there are
not only possm but placita, for in such there can be no use of absolute rea-
son: we see it fiuniliarly in games of wit, as chess, or the lil<c3 the drauohts
and first laws of the game are positive, but how? merely ad placitum Dand
not examinable by reason: but then how to dire& our play thereupon, with
best advantage to win the ganne, is artificial and rational. So in human
laws, there bc many grounds and maxims, which are placita juris, positive
upon authority and not upon reason, and therefore not to be disputed ε but
what is most just, not absolutely, but relatively and according to those
maxims, that affordeth a long field of disputation. Such thereforeis that
secondary reason, which hath place in divinity‚ which is grounded upon
the placets of God. ”

HERE thereforeI note this deficicnce, that there harh not been to my De nsuicozffi-
understanding sufficiently inquii-ed and handled‚ the true limits and use of “¹0 “115⁰ss
reason in spiritual things, as a kind of divine dialeffick, which for thar ltdivin‘jsme ³¹¹
is not done, it seemeth to me a thing usual, by pretext of true conceiving ”
that which is revealed, to search and mine into that which is not revealed,
and by pretext of enucleating inferences and contradiEtories, to examine that
which is positive: the one sort falling into the error of Nicodemm, demand-
ing to have things made more sensible than it pleased God to reveal thern,
Qtomodopoffi’t homo nafii cum fit finex ,2 the other sort into the error of the
,disciples, which were scandalized at a ssmw of contradifflon‚ „Qtid cst hoc
quod dicit nobis ,Ρ modicum (ἐν non videbitis me, όν iterum modicum, ᾤ’
videbitis me, &a ι

UPoN thisI have infistcd the more, in regard of the great and blcss'ed
usethereof, for this point well laboured and defined of, would in my judg-
ment be an opiate to stay and bridle not only the vanity of curious specula-
tions‚ wherewith the schools labour, but the fury of controverfies, where-
with the church laboureth. For it cannot but open mens eyes, to see that
many controvcrfies do merely pertain to that which is either not revealed,
or positive, and that many others do grow upon weak and obscure inferen—
ces or derivations; which later sort, if men would revive the bless'ed stvle
of that great dodor of the Gentiles, would be carried thus; Ego, non ‘Do-
minus3 and again, Secundum confilium meum, in opinions and eounsels, and
not in pofitions and oppositions. But men are now over-ready to usurp the
style, Non ego, fi’d Dominus, and not so only, but to bind it with the thun-
der and denunciation of curses and anathema's, to the terror of those which
have not sufficiently learned out of Salomon, that the causeless curse shall
not come.

D1v1N1 ΤΥ hath two principalparts3 the matter informed or revealed,
and the nature of the infor-marion or revelation: and with the later we will
begin, because it hath most coherence with that which we have now last
handled‚ The nature of the information confisteth of three branchess the
limits of the information‚ the sufficiency of the information, and the ac·
quiring or obtaining the information. Unto thelimits of the information‚
belong these confiderations; how far forth particular persons continue to be
inspired3 how far forth ,the church is inspircd‚ an'd how far forth reason

may be used ,- the. last point whereof Ι have noted as deficient. Pigro the
