It is likewise said of beasts, Qtis pstttaco docuitfimm 2<⁵23i2⁵5 xvho taught the
raven in a drought to throw pebbles into an hollow trec where {he cipit-d
water, that the water might rise so as she might come to it? NV ho taught
the bee to liril through such avast sea of air, and ro find the way from a
field in flower, a great way off, to her hive? who taught the ant to bite
every grain of corn that she burieth in her hill, lest it should take root and
grow.= Add then the word extundere, which importeth the extreme diffi-
culty ‚- and the world paulatim, which importeth the extreme ssowness ς and
we are where we were, even amongst the AEgyptian gods‘, there being
little left to the faculty of reason, and nothing to the duty of art for maf—
tet of invention.

SECONDLY, the indufflon which the logicians speal( of, and which
seemeth familiar with Plato, whereby the principles of sclenecs may be
pretended to be invented, and so the middle propositions by derivation from
the principle33 their form of induffion, Isay, is utterly vicious and incom-
petent5 wherein their error is the fouler, because it is the duty of art to
perfect and exalt nature3 but they contrariwise have wronged, abused and
traduced nature. For he that {hall attentively observe how the minddoth
gather this excellent dew of knowledge, like unto that which the poet
speaketh of Abrei mellis caelestia dona, distilling and contriving it out of par-
ticular-s natural and artificial, as the flowers of the field and garden, {hall
find that the mind of herself by nature doth manage and a& an induerim,
much better than they describe it. For to conclude upon an enumeration
of particulars without instance contradies‘tory, is no conclusion, but a
conicetur& for who can ass'ure (in many subjecis) upon those particular-s
’ which appear of a fide, that there are not other on the contrary fide which
appear not. As if Samuel should have rested upon those sons of Jeſj'ey,
which were brought before him, and failed of David which was in the
field. And this form (to say truth) is so gross, as it had not been pofl'rble
for wits so subtile, as have managed these things, to have offered it to the
world, but that they hasted to their theories and dogmaticals, and were
imperious aud scornful toward particulars, which their manner was to use,
bur as lisJores and viatores for sergeants and whifflers, ad fitmmovendam tur-
bam, to make way and make room for their opinions, rather than in their
true use and service: certainly it is a thing may touch a man with a religi-
ous wonder to see how the footsteps of seducement are the very same in di—
vine and human truth; foras in divine truth man cannot endureto become as
achild,- so in human, they reputed theattendingtheindufflons (whereofwe
speak) as if it were aseeond infancy or childhood.

T H 1 R D L Y, allow some principles or axioms were rightly induced, yet
nevertheless certain it is, that middle propositions cannot be dedueed from
them in subject of nature by syllogism, that is, by touch and reduffion of
them to principles in a· middle term. It is true, thatin sciences popular,
as moralities, laws, and the like; yea and divinity, (because it plcaseth God
to apply himself to the capacity of the simplest) that form may have use,
and in natural philosophy likewise, by way of argument or satisfastory rca-
