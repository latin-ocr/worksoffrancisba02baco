Bookl. OF LEARNING.

illuminate by learning, they have those notions of religion, policy and mo·-
tality, which do preserve them, and resi-ain them from all ruinous and pe-
rcmptory errors and excesseS, whil'pering evermore in their earS, when
counsellors and servants fland mute and illem, and senators or counsellors
likewise which be learned, do proceed upon more liu-‘e and substantial prin·
ciples, than counsellors which are only men of experience3 thc onc sort keep-
ing dangers asar off, whereas the other discover them not till they come
near hand, and then trust to the agility of their wit to ward or avoid
them. ⁰

Wmca felicity of times, under learned princes, (to keep ssill the law
of brevity, by using the most eminent and selected examples) doth best ap-
pear in the age which passed from the death of Domitianus the emperor,
until the reign of Commodus ,- comprehending a meceffion of fix princes,
all learned, or singular favourers and advancers of learning ς which age, sor
temporal respects, was the most happy and fiourflhfflg, that ever the Roman
empire (which then was a model ot the world) enjoyed 3 a matter revealed
and prefigured unto Domitian in a dream the night before he was ilain3
’ fot he thought there was grown behind upon his shoulders a neck and a head
of go’ld, which came accordingly to pass in those golden times which suc-
cceded, of which princes we will make some commemoration: wherein
although the matter will be vulgar, and may be thought fitter sor a declama-
tion than agreeable to a treatise infolded as this is ,- yet because it is pertinent
to the point in hand, Neque semper arcum tendit Apollo ,- and to name thern
only were too naked and cursory ,- Iwill nor omit it altogether. The first
was Nerva, the excellent temper of whose government, is by a glauce in
Cornelius Tacitus touched to the life z Postquam divus N erva res olim in-
sociables miscutffet, imperium ὢν libertatem. And in token of his learning,
the last aCt of his {hort reign left to memory, was a miffive to his adopted son
Trajan, proceeding upon some inward discontent at the ingratitude of the
times, comprehended in a verse of Homer's 3

Telis, Phoebe, tuis lacrymas ulciscere nostras.

T RA J A N, who succeeded, was for his person not learned τ But if we will
hearken to the speech of our Saviour, that saith, He that recei-veth a pro-
phet in the name of a prophet, fhall have a prophet’s reward, he deferveth
to be placed amongst the most learned prince53 for there was not a greater
admirer of learning, or benefactor of learning5 a founder of famous libraries,
a perpetual advancer of learned men to office, and a familiar converser with

⁷ learned professors and preceptors, who were noted to have then most credit
in court. On the other side, how much T rcq'an's virtue and government
was admired and renowned, surely no testimony of grave and faithful history
doth more lively set fdrth, than that legend tale of Gregorius Magnus bilhop
of Rome, who was noted for the extreme envy he bore towards all heathen
excellency3 and yet he is reported, out of the love and estimation of T ra-
jan's moral virtues, to have made unto God paffionate and fervent prayers
for the delivery of his soul out of hell 3 and to have obtained it with a ca-
veat, that he should make no more such petitions. In this prince’s time
also, the persecutions against the Christians received intermiffion upon the
certificate of Plinius Secundus, a man of excellent learning, and by Trajan

advanced. Ἴ
