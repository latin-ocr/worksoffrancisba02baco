 

Bookll. OF LEARNING.

T H ER E are also other parts of learning which are appendices to history :
for all the exterior proceedings of man confist of words and deeds ,- whereos
history doth properly receive and retain in memory the decds ,- and if words,
yet but as inducements and pass'ages to deeds z So are there other books and
writings which are appropriate to the eustody and receipt of words only,
which likewise are of three sorts; orations, letters, and brief speechcs
or sayings: orations are pleadings, speeches of couneil, laudativcs‚ invec-
tives‚ apologies, reprehenfiOiis; orations of formality or ceremony, and the
like. Letters :ire according to all the variety of occasions, adver-tisenients,
advices, direffions, propofition3‚ peritioris, commendarery, expostulatory, lii-
tisfaerory3 of complement‚ of plcasure, of discourse, and all other pass'ages
of astion. ·

A N D such as are written from wisc men, are of all the words of man, in
my judgmcnt the best3 for they are more natural than orations and publick
speeches, and more advised than conferences or present speechcs. So again
letters of affairs from such as manage them, or are privy to them, are
of all others the best instrufflons for history, and to a diligent rcader, the
best histor-ies in themselves. For apophthegms, it is a great loss of that book
of Caefir's 3 for as his history, and those few letters of his which we have,
and those apophthegms which were of his own, excel all mens else, so 1 sup-
pose would his collestion of apophthegms have done ς for as for those which
are collected by others, either I have no taste in such matters, o'r else
their ehoiee hath not been happy. But upon these three kinds of writings
Ι do not insist, because Ι have no deficiencies to propound concerning‘
them.

Tuus much therefore concerning history3 'which is that part of learning
which answereth to one of the cells, domiciles, or offices of the mind of man,
which is that of the mernoryz

ΡΟ EsY is a part of learning in measure of words for the most part restrain-
τά, but in all other points extremely licensed, and doth truly refer to the
imaginatiom which being not tyed to the laws of matter, may at pleasure join
that which nature harh sever'd‚ and sever that which nature harh joined, and
so make unlawful matches and divorces of things3 Pistoribm atque poetis,
&a It is taken in two senses in respest of words or matter3 in the first
sense it is but a charaeter os style, and belongeth to arts of speech, and is not
pertinent for the present: in the later, it is (as hath been said) one of the prin*-
cipal portions of learning, and is nothing else but seigned history, which may
be styled as well in prose as in verse. K

THE use of this feigned history hath been ‘to give some ffiadow o'f satis-
faffion to the mind of man in those points, wherein the nature of things
doth deny it, the world being in proportion inferior to the soul'3 by reason
whereof there is, agreeable to the spirit of man, a more ample greatness, a?
more exa& goodnes5‚ and a more absolute variety, than can be found in the
nature of things. Therefore, because the asts or events of true history harh
not that magnitude which satisfieth the mind of man, poesy feigneth acts and
events greater and more heroica! ς because true history propoundeth the suc-
cesses and iffues of actions not so agreeable to the merits of virtue and vice,
therefore poesy felgus them more just in retribution‚ and more according
to revealed providenee 3 because true history representeth aetions and events
more ordinary, and less interchanged 3 therefore poesy endueth them

with more rareness, and more unexpeeted and alternative variations: So
