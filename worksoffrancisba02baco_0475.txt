ΑΝ D as nothing doth derogate from the dignity of a ssate more than
confnfion of degi-ecs: so it doth not a little {mix-ise the anthol-itt 01' an
history, to interniinglc mattersv of triumph, 01· matters of cereinonv, 01·
matters of novelty, with matters of state : ‚But the nse of a journal harh natv
only been in the history of time, but likewisc in the history os persons,
and chiefly of afflons : for princes in ancient time had, upon point os ho*
nour and policy both, jour-nais kept, what passed day by day ε for we see
the chronicle which was read before Ahaffiierus, when he could not take
rest, contained matter of affairs indeed, but such as had passed in his own
time, and very lan—ly before : bnt the Journal of Alexana'er’s house expres-
sed ever)- small particularity, even concerning his person and court ‚- and it
is yet an use well received in enterprizes memor-able, as expeditioris of war,
navigations, and the like, to keep diarics of that which pass'eth continu-
allv.

I CANNoT likewise be ignorant of a form of writing‚ which son‘ie
grave and wisc men have used, containing a scattered history of those affions
which they have thought worthy of memory, with politick disconrse and ob-
servation thereupon3 not incorporated into the history, but separately,
and as the more principal in their intenti0n3 which kind of ruminated hi-
story Ithink more fit to place amongst books of policy‚ whereof we shall
hereafter speak, than amongst books of history ε fot itis the true office of
history to represent the events themselves together with the counsels, and to
leave the observations and conclusions thereupon, to the liberty and faculty
“ of every man’s judgment5 but mixtur-cs are things irregular, whereof no man
can define. ’

So also is there another kind of history manifoldly mix'd, and that is
history of cosmography‚ being componnded of natural history in respect of
the regions themselves, of history civil in respeft of the habitations‚ regi*-
ments and manners of the people ‚- and the mathematicks in respect of the
climatcs and configurations towards the heavens : which part of learning of
all others in this later time hath obtained most proficience. For it may be
truly affirmcd to the honour of these times, and in a virtuous emulation with
antiquity‚ that this great building of the world had never thorongh lights
made in it, till the age of ns and our fathers: for although they had know-
ledge of the antipodes,

Nosque ubi primns equis oriens afflavit anhelis,
Illic fi'ra rubens accendit lumina vesper:

Yet that might be by demonstration‚ and not in fast3 and if by travel‚ it re-
quireth the voyage but of half the globe. But to circle the earth, as the hea-
venly bodies do, was not done nor enterprized till these latet times ε and
therefore these times may justly bear in their word, not only plns ultra in
precedence of the ancient non ultra, and imitabile fulmen, in precedence
of the ancient non imitabile fulmen,

Demens qui nimbos &⁵ non imitabile fulmen, &a
But likewise

Imitabile coelum .-
