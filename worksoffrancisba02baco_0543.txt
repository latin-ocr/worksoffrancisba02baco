Bookll. OF LEARNI’NG.

Βυτ the soundest diselosing and expouutlingr of men is, by their naturcs
and ends; whcrcin the weakest sort of men are best interpreted by their na-
tures‚ and the wisest by their ends. For it was both pleasantly and wisely
said, (though Ι think very untruly) b'y a nuncio of the pope, returninev from
a certain nation, where hc sci-ved as lieget3 whose opinion being asketliouch-
ing the appointment of onc to go in his place, he wished that in any case
they did not send one that was too wisc-3 because no very wiseman would
ever imagine, what they in that-countrcy were like to do : and certainly it is
an error frequent for men to shoot over, and to suppose deeper endS, and
more compass reaches than are: The Italian proverb being elegant, and

for the most part true,

Di danari, di stum, e di fede,

Ce' ni> manco che uon credi .·

There is commonly less money, less wisdom, and less good saith, than men
do account upon.

B UT princes, upon a far other reason, are best interpreted by their natures,
:ind private persons by their ends: for princes being at the top of human de-
fires‚ they have for the most part no particular ends whereto they aspire, by
distance from which a man might take measure ancl scale of the rest'of their
afflons and desires ,- which is one of the causes that maketh their hearts more
inscrutablc. Neither is it sufficient to inform our selves in mens ends and
natures of the variety of them only, but also of the predominancy, what hu-
mour reigneth most, and what end is principally sought. For so we see,
when Tigellinus saw himself out-stripped by Petronius Turpilianus in A⁷erds
humours of pleasures; metus ejus rimatur, he wrought upon Nero‘s fears,
whereby he broke the other's neck. '

Bu 1· to all this part of inquiry, the most compendious way resteth in three
things z the first, to have general acquaintance and inwardness with those
which have general acquaintance, and look most into the world ,- and espe-
cially according to the diverfity of bufiness, and the diversity of personS, to
have privacy and conversation with some one friend at least, which is perfest
and well intelligenced in every several kind. The second is to keep a good
mediocrity in liberty of speech and secrecy: in most things liberty, secrecy
where it importeth; for liberty of speech inviteth and provoketh liberty to
be used again, and so bringeth much to a man's knowledge3 and secrecy on
the other sicle induceth trust and inwardness. The last is the reducing of a
man’s self to-this watchful and serene habit, as to make account and purpose
in every conference and aetion, as well to observe as to act. For as Epitre-
tus would have a philosopher in every particular aetion to say to himself, Et
hoc volo, ἄν etiam institutum servare .·’ so a politick man in every thing
should say to himself, Et hoc volo, ac etiam aliquid addifiere. Ι have
stay’d the longer upon this precept 'of obtaining good information ‚- because
it is a main part by it sels, which answereth to all the rest. But above all
things caution must be taken, that men have a good stay and hold of themselves,
and that this much knowing do not draw on much meddling; for nothing
is more unfortunate than light and ralh intermeddling in many matters, So
that this variety of knowledge tendeth in conclusion but only to this, to
make a better and freer choice of those actions which may concern uS, and
to condust them with the less error and. the more dexte'rity.
