OF THE ADVANCEMENT Boole

nemsbnat, it is a voice beyond 1110 light of nature: So we see the heathcn
poetS, when they fall upon 3 libertine passion, do still expostulate with laws
and 111013111105, 35 if they were opposite and malignam to 1131111ος Et qnod
natura remittit, Invida jura neganti So said Dendamjs the Indiam 3111οΑ-
lexander's mess'engcrss “ That he had heard somewhat of Pythagoras, and
‘⁶ some other of the wisc men of Graecia, and that he held them fot ex-
“ cellent men: but that they had a fault, which waS, that they had in too
‘⁶ great reverence and venerarion, a thing they called law and manners.’'
Sobit must be confefl'ed that a great part o‘f the law moral is of that perfec-
tion, whereunto the light of nature cannot aspire: how then is it, that
man is said to have by the light and law of 11311110, some notions and 0011-
00115 of virtue and vice, justice and wrong, good and evil? Thus, because
the light of nature is used in two several sense83 the one, that which spring-
eth from reason, sense, 1111111611011, argument, according to the laws of hea-
ven and earth3 the other, that which 15 imprinted upon the spirit of man
by an inward instinct, according to the law of conscience, which is a spar-
kle of the purity of his first estate: in which later sense only he is patti-
cipant of forne light and discerning touehing the perfefflon of the moral
law: but how? Sufficient to cheek the vice, but not to inform the duty. So
then the doctrine of religion, as well moral 35 mystical, is not 10 be attain-
ed‚ but by inspiration and revelation from God.

THE use notwithstanding of reason in spiritual things, and the latitude
thereos, is very great 31111, general; for it is not for nothing that the Apostle
calleth religion our “ reasonable service? of God, insomuch 35 1110 very cere-
monies and figures of the old law were full of reason and fignification‚
much more than the ceremonies of idolatry and magick, that are full of
non-fignificants and surd 011313610155 but most especially the christian faith,
as in all things, fo in this, deserveth to be highly magnified, holding and
preserving the golden mediocrity in this point, between the law of the hea-
then, and the law of Mahomet‚ which have embraced the two extremes.
For the religion of the heathen had no constant belief or confeffion, but
left all to the liberty of argument3 and the religion of Malwmet on the other
fide, interdisteth argument altogether, the one having the very face of 01-
101, and the other of imposture; whereas the saith doth both admit and
rejest disputation with difference.

THE use of human reason in religion is of two sorts: the former in the
conception and apprehension of the mysteries of God to us revealed; the
other, in the inserting and deriving of doctrine and 1111οἃ1011 thereupon.
The former extendeth to the mysteries themselves; but how? By way of il·
lustration‚ and not by way of argument: the later consisteth indeed of pro-
bation and argument. In the former we see God vouchsafeth to descend
to our capacity, in the expreffing of his mysteries in sort as may be senfi-
ble unto us; and doth graft his revelations and holy doctrine upon the no-
tions of our reason, and applieth his inspirations to open our understand-
ing, as the form of the key to the ward of the lock3 for the later, there
is allowed us an use of reason and argument, secondary and respeffloe, al-

-though not original and absolute. For after the articles and principles of

religion are placed and exempted from examination of reason, it is then
permitted unto us to make derivations and inferences from, and according
‘0 the analogy Qf them, for our better direction. In nature this holdeth
not, for both the principles ate examinable by induffion, though not by a.
