how they are donc, yet we know well it is not as it l'eemcth to [πῆ vet ihc
more subtile sort of rhem doth not only put a man besides his ausu-er, hut
doth many times abuse his judgment.

Tffls part coneerning Elenches, is excellently handled byArstosleinpre-
cept, but more excellently by ‘Plato in example3 not only in the pei-somv of
the sophists, but even in Socrates himself, who profeffing„⁷ ro affirm nothing,
but to infirm that which was affirmed by another, harh exacily exprclled
all the forms of objectioni, fallacy and redargution. Ant-1 although we have
said that the use of this doarine is for redargutionz yet it is manifest, the
degenerate and corrupt use is for caption and contradiction, which palleth
for a great faculty, and no doubt is of very great advantage, though the
difference be good which was made between orators and sophistas, that the
one is as the greyhound, which hath his advantage in the racc, and the o-
ther as the hare, which harh her advantage in the turn, so as it is the ad-
vantage of the weaker creature.

Bur yet farther‚ this doctrine of Elenches hath a more ample latitude and
extent, than is perceived; namely, unto divers parts of knowledgc3 where-

* , of some ate laboured, and others omitted. For first l conceive (though it

may seem at first somewhat strange) that that part which is vai-iably rc-
ferred, sometimes to logick, sometimes to meraphyfiek, touching the com-
mon adjunsts of ess'enceS, is but an Elenche3 for the great sop'11ism of all so-
phisms, being equivocation or ambiguity of words and phrase, especially
of such words as are most general and intervene in every inquii-y: it seem-
eth to me that the true and fruitful uses (leaving vain subtilties and specu-
lations) of the inquiry of majority, minority‚ priority, posteriority‚ identi-
ty, diverfity‚ possibility, aet, totality, pattS, existence, privation, and the
like, are but wife cautions against ambiguities of speech. So again, the
distribution of things into certain tribes, which we call categories or
predicaments‚ ate burcautions against the confusion of definitions and di·
vifions.

SEcoNDLY, there is a seducement that worketh by the strength of the
impreffion, and not by the subtilty of the illaqueation‚ not so much per-
plexing the reason, as over-ruling it by power of the imagination. But this
part 1 think more proper to handle, when Ι {hall speak of rhetorick.

Bur lastly‚ there is yet a much more important and profound kind o'f
fallacies'in the mind of man, which Ι find not observed or inquired at all,
and think good to place here, as that which of all others appertaineth most
to reetify judgment: The force whereof is such, as it doth not dazle or
snare the understanding in some particulam, but doth more generally and
inwardly infe& and corrupt the state thereos. For the mind of man is far
‚from the nature of a clear aud equal glass, wherein the beams of things
lhould refleec according to their true incidence3 nay, it is rather like an

‘inchanted glast, full of superstition and impostum, if it be not delivered and
seduced. For this purpose, let us confidet the false appearanees that are
imposed upon us by the general nature of the mind, beholding them in an
‘example or two, as first in that instance, which is the root of all supersti-
tion: namcly, that to the nature of the mind of all men it is consonant 'for
the affirmative ot active to effect, more than the negative or privative. So
that a few times hitting, or presence, countervails oft-times failing or ab·
sence; as was well answered by Diagoras, to him that shewed him in Nep-
’ tzme's temple, the great number of pistuteS, of such as had escaped {hip-
