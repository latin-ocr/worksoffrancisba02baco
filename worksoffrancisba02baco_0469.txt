that duty of humanity3 Nam qui erranti comiter monstrat viam, &a 1 do
foresee likewffc, that if thosc things which 1 shall enter and regisler, as de-
ficicncics and omissions, many will conceive and censure, that some of them
are already done and extant; others to bc but euriolities‚ and things of no
great³use3 and others to be of too‘great difficulty, and almost impollibility to
bc compall'ed and effe-steti: but't'or the two first,' 1 refer my self to the parti—
culais. For the last, ronching impollibiliry, Itake it, those things are robe
hcldp‘offiblc which may bc done'by some person, though not by every one-3
and which may bc donc by many, though not by any one ς and which may
be done in succeffion of ages, though not within the honr-glass of one man's
life ,- and which may be donc by publiek designation, though not by private
endeavour.

‘Bur · notwithstanding, if any man will take to himself rather that of
Salomon, Dicit plger leo cst in via, than that of lsirgil, ‘Poffunt qnia posse

’ The parts of human learning have reference to the three parts of man's
understanding, which is the scat of learning3 history to his memor-y, poesy to
hiff'i‘mhgination, and philosophy to his reason : Divine learning receiveth the
fame distribution, for the spirit of a man is the same, though the· revelation of
oracle³ and sense be divers: so as theology consisteth also of history of the
cliurchss *of parabies, which is divine poesy, and of holy doctrine or precept t
Por‘ asfor that part which secmeth supernumerary, which is propheey‚ it is
bu't divine history3 which hath that prerogativc over human, as the narration
may be before the fact, as well as after. ”
ζ’“’Ῐ““Ιῌ ςτο·κΥ is natural, civil, ecelesiastical, and literary‚ whereof the three HistoriaLice-
first‘rallow as extant, the fourth I note as deficient. For no man hath pro· mum·
pounded to him self the general state of learning to be described and representss
edfrdm' age to age, as many have -done the works of nature, and the state civil
and ecclesiasticak without which the history of the world seemeth to me to be
ἃς thestatua of Polyphemus with his eye out, that part being wanting which
dotlinrost lhew the spirit and life of the person : And yet 1 am not ignorant,
thatin divers particular scienccs, as of the jurisconsults‚ the mathematicians,
fherhetoricians, the philosophch, there are set down some small memorials
of the schools, authors ancl books; and so likewise some barren relations
touching the invention of arts or usages.

knowledges and their fests ‚- their inventions, their traditions; their divers
administrations and managings3 their flourilhings, their oppolifions, ἀεῖ-3515,
depre'ffions‚ oblivions, removes, with the causes and occasions of them, and
ass' ‘o'ther events concerning learning throughout the ages of the'world, 1 may
trnly affirm to be wanting. ⁴ ’ -ῑ-
’ THE, use and end of which work, I do not so much delign for curiosity ot
fatisfaffion of those that are the lovers of learning, but chiefly-for a more se-
rit-miand grave purpose, whieh' is this in few words, that it will make learned
men³wise in the use and administration of learning. For it is not St. Am
gustin'e’s nor St. Ambrose's works-'that will make so wisc a divine, as eccle-
fiasticaiqhistory throughly read and observed ,- and the same reason is of
learnin · ν ’“ “
