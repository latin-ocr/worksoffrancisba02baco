OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookll

H rs T o nv of nature is of three forts,- of nature in course, os nature er-
ring or varying, and os nature altered or wrought ς that is, history osereatures,
history of marvails, and history of arts.

THE first of these no doubt is extant, and that in good pcrfcffion 5 the
two later are handled so weakl y and unprolitably, as l ain iuoved to note them
as deficient.

120 R Ι find no sufficient or competent colleelion of the works of nature,
which haye a digression and defflexion from the ordinary course of genera-
tions, p1·odu&ions and motionS, whether they be singularities of place and -
region, Orthe strange events of time and chance, or the effests of yet un—
known properties, or the instances of exceptions to general kinds : lt is true,
l find ει number of books of fabulous experiments and secretS, and frivolous
impostures for pleasure and strangencss.

B U T a substantial and severe colleflion of heteroclitcs, or irregularities of
nature well examined and described I find not, especially not with due rejec-
tion of sables, and popular errors ι for as things now arc, if an untruth in
nature be once on foot, what by reason of the neglect of examination and
countenance of antiquity‚ and what by reason of the use of the opinion in
fimilitudes and ornaments of speech, it is never called down.

THE use of this work, honoured with a precedent in Amstotle, is nothing
less than to give contentmcnt to the appetite of curious and vain wits, as the
manner of mirabilarics is to do5 but for two reasonS, both of great weight:
the one to correct the partiality of axiotns ancl opinions, which are commonly
framed only upon common and famili-ar example& the other, because from
the wonders of nature, is the nearest intelligcnce and passage towards the
wonders of art : for it is no more, but by following, and as it were hound-
ing nature in her wanderingS, to be able to lead her afterwards to the same
place again.

N E 1 T n E R am I of opinion in this history of mar-vans, that superstitious
narrations of sorceries, witchcrafts, dreams, divinationS, and the like, where
there is an affurance and clear evidence of the fast, be altogether excluded.
For it is not yet known in what cases, and how far efferis attributed to super-
stition, do participate of natural causes: and therefore howsoever the practice
of such things is to be condemned, yet from the speculation and consideration
of them, light may be taken, not only for the discerning of the offences, but
for the farther disclofing of nature : neither ought a man to make scruple of
entring into these things for inquisition of truth, as your majcsty hath shewed
in your own example ,- who with the two clear eyes of religion and natural
philosophy, have looked deeply and wisely into these shadows, and yet proved
your self to be of the nature of the sun, which pass'eth through polludons,
and it self rcmains as pure as before.

B υ T this 1 hold fit, that these narrations, which have mixture with super·
stition, be sortcd by themselves, and not to bc mingled with the narrations‚
which are merely and fincercly natural.

BU T as for the narrations touching the prodigies and miracles of religi-

ons, they arc either not true, or not natural ,- and therefore impertinent for
the story of nature.
