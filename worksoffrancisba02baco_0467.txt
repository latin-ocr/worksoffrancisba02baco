annexed the commodity of gardens for {imples of all forts, and do likewjse
command the use of dead bodies for anatomies: But these do respcst but a
few things. ln general, there will hardly be any main proficicnce jn the
disclofing of nature, except there be some allowanee for expenees about ex-
perimentss whether they be experiments appertaining to Vulcanus or Dae-
dalus, furnace or cngine, or any other kind: and therefore as secretaries and
¹spials of princes and states bring in bills for intelligenee‚ so you must allow
the spials and intelligences of nature to bring in their billS, or else you shall

ANorHER defest whiehI note, is an interniission or neglect in those
which are governours in universities, of consultation, and 111 princes or su-
perior persons of visitation: To enter into account and consideration, whe-

anciently begun‚ and since continued, be well instituted or no, and there-
‘upon to ground an amendment or reformation in that which ssiall be found
inconvenient. For it is one of your majesty's own most wise and princely
maxims, “ That in all usages and precedente», the times be confider'd wherein
“ they first began, which if they were weak or ignorant, it derogateth from
“ the authority of the usage, and leaveth it for suspen? And therefore in
as much as most of the usages and orders of the univcrsities were derived
from more obscure times, it is the more requisite they be re-cxamined. In
this kind 1 will give an instance or two for example lake, of things that are
the most obvious and familiar z the one is a matter which though it be ancient
and general, yet Ihold to be an error, which 15, that scholars in univer-
fities corne too soon and too unripe to logici< and rhetoriek‚ arts fit-
ter'for graduates than children and novices ‚- for these two rightly ta-
ken, are the gravest of scientes, being the arts of arts‚ the one for
judgment, the other for ornament. And they be the rules and directions
how to set forth and dispose matters and· therefore for minds empty and
unfraught with matter, and which have not gathered that which Cicero
calleth S ylva and Supellex, stuff and variety ς 10 begin with those arts (as if
one should learn to weigh or to measure, or to paint the wind‚) doth work
but this 0110615 that the wisdom of those arts‚ which is great and universal,
is almost made contemptible‚ and is degenerare into 01111011111 sophistry and
ridiculous affectation. And farther, the untimely learning of· them harh
drawn on, by consequence, the superficial and unprofitable teaehing and
writing of 1110111, as fitteth indeed to the capacity of children. Another, is
a lack 1 find in the exercises used in the universities, which do make too
great a divorce betwecninvcntion and memory ,- for their speeehes are ei-
