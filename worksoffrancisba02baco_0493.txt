aptly and elegantly3 ‘⁶ As the tongue spenketh to the ear, so the gesture
“ spe-aketh to the eye.'' And therefore a number oflubtle persons, whole
eyes do dwell upon the faces and fafliions of men, do well know the ad.-
vantage of this obser-vatinii, as being most part oftheir ability3 neither cant
it bc denied, but that it 12< a great discovery of dissimulations, and a great
direction in business.

strophe that the former harh. For the consideration is double-3 “ Either
“ how, and how far the humours and effests of the body do alter or work
“ upon th'e mind;'' or again, “ How, and how far the paffions or appre-
“ lienfions of the mind do alter or work upon the body.'' The for-
mer of these hath been inquired and considered, as a part and appen-
dix of medicine, but much more as a part of religion or supersti-
tion: For the physician prescribeth cures of the mind in frenfies and me-
lancholy paffions, and pretendeth also to exhibit medicincs to exhilarate
the mind, to confirm the courage, to clarify the wits‚ to corroborate the
memory, and the like: but the scruples 'and superstitious of diet, and ο-
ther regiment of the body in the seer of the Pythagoream, in the heresy of
the Manicheam, and in the law of Mahomet do exceed: So likewise the ordi-
nances in the ceremonial law, interdiffing the eating of the blood and the
fat, distinguishing between beasts ‘clean and unclean for meat, are many
and strict. Nay the faith it self, being clear and serene from all clouds of
ceremony, yet retaineth the use of fastings‚ abstinencies, and other mace-
rations and humiliations of the body, as things real and not figurative.
The root and life of all which prescripts‚ is (besides the ceremony) the
consideration of that dependency‚ which the affest'ions of the mind ate
submitted tinto, upon the state and disposition of the body. And if any
man of weak judgment do conceive, that this suffering of the mind from
the body, doth either question the immortality, or derogate from the sove-
reignty of the soul, he may be taught in easy instances‚ that the infant in
the mother's womb is compatible with the mother, and y'et separable: and
the most absolute monarch is sometimes led by his servants, and yet with-
out subjestion. As for the reciprocal knowledge, which is the operation of
the conceits and paffions of the mind uponthe body; we see all wise phy-
ficians, in the prescriptions of their regiments to their patients, do ever
consider academia animi3 as of great force to further or hinder remedie
or rccoverics3 and more especially it is an inquiry of great depth and worn
concerning imagination‚ how, and how far it altereth the body proper of
the imaginant. For although ir harh a manifest power to burt, it fol-
ioweth not, it hath the same degree of power to help3 no more than a
man can conclude, that because there be pestilent aits, able suddenly to
kill a man in health‚ therefore there should be sovereign aits, able sud-
denly to cure a man in fickness. But the inquisition of this part is of great
use; though it neodem, as Socrates said, aDelian diver, beingdifficult and
profound. But unto all this knowledge de communi vinculo, of the concor-
dances between the mind and the body: that part of inqu'iry is most neces-
sary, which confidercth of the seats and domiciles, which the several facul-
ties of the mind do take and occupate in the organs of the body3 which
knowledge harh been attempted, and is controverted‚ and deserveth to be
muchbetter inquired. For the opinion of Plato, who placed the understanding
in t-he brain, animofity, (which he did unfitly callanger, having a greater
