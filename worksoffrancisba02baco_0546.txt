OF THE ADVANCEMENT Book Π,

medy ,- namelv, to depress and seem to despise whatsoever a man cannot ar·
tain observing the good principle of the merchants, who endeavour tomise
the price of their own commodities, and to beat down the price of others.
But there is a confidence that palleth this other, which is to face out a
man's own defens, in seeming to conceive that he is best in those things
wherein he is failing 3 and to help that again, to seem on the other fide
that he harh least opinion of himself, in those things wherein he is best;
like as we shall see it commonly in poets, that if they ssiew their verses,
and you except to any, they will say, “ That that line cost them more la-
“ bour than any of the rest;’' and presently will seem to disable and
suspect rather some other line, which they know well enough to be the
best in the number. But above all, in this righting and helping of a
man's self in his own carri-ige, he must take heed he ssiew not himself dis-
mantled, and exposed toscorn and injury, by too much dulceness, good-
nesS, and facility of nature, but lhew some sparkles of liberty, spirit and
edge: Which kind of fortified carriage, with a ready rescuing ,of a
man's self from scorns, is sometimes of necessity imposed upon men by
somewhat in their person or fortune, but it ever succeeded with good
felicity.

ANOTH ER precept of this knowledge is by all poffible endeavour to
frame the mind to be pliant and obedient to occasion 3 for nothing hinder-
eth men's for-tunes so much as this; Idem manebat, neque idem decebat.
Men are where they were, when occasions turn3 and therefore to Cato,
whom Livy maketh such an archite& of fortune, he addeth, that he had
verftztlle iizgenium: and thereof it comedi, that these grave solemn wits
which must be like themselves, and cannot make departures, have more
dignity than felicity: but in some it is nature to be somewhat viscous and
inwrapped, and not easy to turn: In some it is a concon, that is almost a
nature, which is that men can hardly make themselves believe that they
ought to change their course, when they have found good by it in former
experience. For Machiavel noteth wisely, how Fabius AIaximus would
have been temporizing still, according to his old biass, when the nature of
the war was altered, and required hot pursuit 3 in some other it is want of
point and penetration in their judgment, that they do not discern when
things have a period, but come in too late after the occafi0n; as Demos:
thenes compareth the people of Athens to countrey fellows‚ when they play
vin a fence school, that if they have a blow, then they remove their weapon
to that ward, and not before. In some other it is a loathness to l'ose la-
bours passed, and a conceit that they can bring about occafions to their ply;
and yet in the end,when they see no other remedy, then they come to it with
disadvantage, as Tarquinius that gave for the third part of Sibylla’s books
the treble price, when he might at first have had all three for the fimple.
But from whatsoever root or cause this restiveness of mind proceedeth,
it is a thing most prejudicial, and nothing is more politick than to make
the Wheels of our mind concentriek and voluble with the wheels of
fortune. .

ANorHER precept of this knowledge, which hath some affinity with
that we last spoke of, but- with differenec, is that which is well expreffed,
fatis accede deisque, that men do not only turn with the oecafionS, but also
run with the occasions, and not strain their credit or strength to over-hard or
extreme points5 but churein their aetion that which is most paffable: for
