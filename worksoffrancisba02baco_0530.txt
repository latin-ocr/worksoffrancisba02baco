31⁶ oF THE ADVANCEME'NT Book-11,

ill-nature, 'benigni ty or malignity. And therefore Ι cannot sufficie'ntly mar-
yel, that this part of knowledge tou'ching the several charae‘ters of *matures an'd
dispofitions, should be omitted both in morality and policy, confideringit
is of so great ministry and suppeditation to them both. A man shall find in
the traditions of astrology‚ some pretty and apt divifions of men's matures,
according to the predominances of 'the planets ,- lovers of quiet, ljovers of
astion, lovers of vidior-y, lovers of honour, lovers of plenium, lovers of
arrs, lovers of change, and so forth. A man [hall find in the wiscst sort df
these relations, which the Italiam make 'touching conclaves, the natures df
the several cardinals, handsomely and lively painted forth 3 a man 'shall
meet within every day's conference, the denominations of senfidve, dry,
formal, real, humorous, certain, Huomo di prima impreffi'one, huomo di
ultima impreffi'one, and the like: and yet nevertheless this kind of observations
wandereth in words, but is not fixed in inquiry. For the distinctions are found
(many of them) but we conclude no precepts upon them; wherein our fault
is the greater, because both history, poesy, and daily experience, are as good·
ly fields where these observations‘grow, whereof we make a few poefies to
-hold in our hands, but ‘no man bringeth them to the confectionum, that r'e-
ceipts might be made of them³for use of life.

O F much like 'kind are those impreffions of nature, which are imposed
upon the mind by the sex, by the age, by the region, by health and fickness,
by beauty and deformity‚ and the'like, which are inherent, and not extern ,-
and again, those which are caused by extern fortune: as loveizeignty, 'nobi-
lity, obscure birth, richeS, want, magistracy, privateness, prosperity, adverfity‚
constant fortune, variable fortune, rifing per fizltum, per gradus, and the
like. And therefore we see that Plautus maketh it a wonder to see an old
manbeneficent,'Bemgnitas hujus ‘uz‘ adolescentuli est. St. ‘Paul conclu·
deth, that severity of discipline was *to be used vto the Cretam, Increpa eos
dure, upon the-disposition of their countrey, Cretenses semper mendaces,
malae bestiae, veneresptgri. Sallust noteth that it is usual with kings to
>desirecoiitradistories3 Sed plerumque regiae voluntates, ut vehementes
sitm, βε mobiles saepeque ipsc'ze sibi adversize. Tacitus observeth, how
rarely raising of the fortune mendeth the disposition, Solus Vespasianus mu-
tatus in melius. Pindarus maketh an obser-vatim, that great and sudden
fortune for the most part defeateth men, Qti magnam felicitatem conco-
'que're non poffitnt. So the Pfizlm lheweth it is more easy to keep a measure
in the enjoying of fortune, than in the increase of fortune : ‘Divitiae st af
fluant, nolite cor apponere. These observations‚ and the like, Ι deny not;
but are touched a little by Aristotle, as in passage in his rhetoricks‚ and are
handled in some scattcred discourses; but they were never incorporate into
moral philosophy, to which they do effentially appertain: as the knowledge
of the diverfity of grounds and molds doth to agriculture, and the knowledge
of the dlversity of complexions and constitutions doth to the phyfician ,- ex-
cept we mean to follow the indiscretion of empiricks, which minister the
vsame medicines to' all patients.

A N o *r H ER article of this knowledge, is the inquiry touching the affec-
fions: for as in medicining of the body, 'it is in order first to know the di-
vers complexions and constitutions; secondly,'‘the diseases3 and lastly, the
curesz' so‘in medicining of the mind, after knowledge of the divers char-asters
of mens natures‚ it followeth‚ in order, to know the diseascs and infirmities
of the mind, which arc no other than the perturbations anddistempers of the
affections. For as the ancient politicians in popular estates were wont
