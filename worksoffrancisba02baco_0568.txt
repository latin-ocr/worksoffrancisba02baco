PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT

Ι confess and deciate, that some fortnight after, as Ι remember, that the
decrec passed, Ireceived 200 l. as from Mr. Scott by Mt. Shute: but prece,
dent promise or transaction by Mr. Shute‚ certain Ι am l knew of none.

To the twelfth article of the charge, viz. he received in the lame
cause, on the part of fir John Lenthall‚ 100 l.

I confess and decl-are, that some month after, as 1 remember, that the
decree paffed, 1 received 100 l. by my servant Sherborn, as from fir John
Lenthall‚ who was not in the adverse party to Scan, but a third person, rc,
lieved by the same decree, in the suit of one Power.

To the thirteenth article of the charge, viz. he received of Mr. lerth

v 100 l. in respect of the cause between him and fir Arthur Alainwaring .-

1 confess and declare, that this cause being a cause for inheritance of
good value was ended by my arbitr-ament, and consent of parties, and so a
decr-ee passed of course; and some month after the cause was ended, the

⁷ 100 l. mentioned in the said. article, was delivered to me by my servant

Hunt. .
To the fourteenth article of the charge, viz. he received of fir szsph
Hansbye, having a cause depending before him, 500 l.

1 confess and declare, that there were two deerees, one as Iremember
for the inheritance, and the other for the goods and chartres, but all-upon
one bill3 and some good time after the first decree‚ and before the second,
the said 500 l. was delivered unto me by Mr. Toby Matthew‚ so as Lean—
not deny but it was upon the matter, pendente lite.

To the fifteenth article of the charge, viz. Wlliam Compton being to
have an extent for a debt of 1200 l. the lord ehaneellor staycd it,v and
wrote his letter, upon which, part of the debt was paid presently‚ and part
ata future day: the lord ehaneellor hereupon sends to borrow 500 l. and
because Compton was to pay 400 l. to one Huxlcy, his lor-dstaip requires
Huxley to forbear fix months3 and thereupon obtains the money from
Compton: the moneybeingunpaid‚ suit grows between Huxley andCompton
in chancery, where his lordship deerees Compton to pay Huxley the dcbt
with damage and cost3‚ when it was in his own hands. -

Ι do declare, that in my conscience the stay of the extent was Just‚--being
an extremity against a nobleman, by whom Compton could be no loscr3
the money was plainly borrowed of Compton upon bond with interest, and
the meffage to Huxley was only to entreat him to give Compton a longer
day, and in no sort to make me debtor or responsible to Huxlcjy3 and
therefore, though 1 was not ready to pay Compton his money, as 1 would

>have been glad to have done, save only 100 l. which is paid, 1 could not

deny justice to Huxley in as ample manner as ‘if nothing had been between
Compton and 15 but if Compton harh been damnified in my respest, Iam
to consider it to Compton. ·

To the fixteenth article of the charge, viz. in the cause between fir
Wllj'am Bronker and Awbrey, the lorcl ehaneellor received from Awbrey
