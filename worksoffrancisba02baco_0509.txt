ΤΗΙ-31η, remaineth one part of iudgmcnt of great excellency, which mmm.
mine understanding is so ssightly touched, as Imay report that also deiici-
ent3 which is the application of the differing kinds of proofs, rothe differ-
ing kinds of subjeetss· for there being but four kinds of demonstrations,
that is, by the immediate consent of the mind or sense, by indtistion, by
syllogism, and by congruity3 which is that which Arz'stotle calleth demon-
stration in orb, or circle, and not a notioribus-3 every of these hath certain
subjectS in the matter of sciences, in which respectivcly they have chiefcst
use5 and certain others, from which respectivcly they ought to be exclu-
ded, and the rigor and curiosity in requiring the more severe proofs in
some thingS, and chiefly the facility in eontenting onrsclves with the more
remiss proofs in others, harh been amongst the greatest causes of detri-
ment and hindrance to knowledge, The distributions and affignations of De analogia*

THE custody or retaining of knowledge is either in writing or memo-num·
ry3' whereof writing hath two partS, the nature of the character, and the
order of the entry: for the art of char-aetem, or other visible notes of
words or things, it hath nearest conjugation with grammar3 and therefore
I refer it to the due place: for the disposition and collocation of that
knowledge which we preserve in writing, it consisteth in a good digest
of common places, wherein Ι am not ignorant of the prejudice imprited
to the use of common-place books, as caufing a retardation of reading,
and some ssoth or relaxation of memory. But because it is but a counter-
fcit thing in knowledges, to be forward and pregnant, except a man be
deep and full, I hold the entry of common places, to bc a matter of great
use and essencc in studying, as that which ass‘nreth copy of invention, and
contr-aerem judgment to a strength. But this is true, that of the methods
of common places that 1 have seen, there is none of any sufficient worth,
all of them carrying merely the face of a school, and not of a world,
and referring to vulgar matters, and pedantical divifions without all life,
or respect to action.
Fon the other principal part of the custody of knowledge, which is
memory, Ifind that faculty in my judgment weakly inquired of. An art
there is extant of ir3 but it seemeth to me that there are better precepts
'than that art, and better practices of that art, than those received. It is
certain the art, as it is, may be raised to points of ostentation prodigious:
But in use (as it is now managed) it is barren, not burdensome, nor dan-
gerous to natural memory, as is imagined, but barren, that is, not dexte-
rous to be applied to the serious use* of business and occasions. And therc-
fore Ι make no more estimation of repeating a great number of names
or words upon once hearing, or the pouring fourth of a number of ver-
ses or thimes ex tempore, or the making of a satyrical simile of every thing,
or the turning of every thing to a jest, or the falfifying or contradicting
of every thing by cavil, or the like, (whereof in the faculties of the mind,
there is great copia, and such as by device and prastice may be exalted to
an extreme degree of wonder) thanI do of the tricks of tumblers‚ fu·
nambuloes, baladines; the one being the same in the mind, that the o-
ther is in the body5 matters of strangeness without worthiness. T
