Bookll. oF LEARNING.

N Ε 1 ‘rnen neederh it at all t'o be doubted, that this knowledge should be
so variable as it falleth not under precept ‚- for it is much less infinite than
seience of government‚ which we sec is labourcd, and in some part reduced.
Of this wildom it seemeth some of the ancient Romans, in the taddcst and
wisest times were profefforss' for Cicero reporteth‚ that it was then in use
for senators that had name* arid opinion for general wife men, as Cmtcncanjus,
Curius, Laelius, and many orbem, to wall< at certain hours in the place,
and to give audie-nce to those that would use their advice, and that¹ the parti-
cular citizens would resort unto them, and consult with them of the mar-
riage of a daughter, or of the employing of a son, or of* a purchase or
bargain, or of an accusat10n‚ and every other occasion incident to man's
life: so as there is awisdom of counscl and advice even in private cases,
a‘rismg out of an universal insight into thc affairs of the world5 which is u*
sed indeed upon particular cases propounded‚ but is gathered by general oba
servation of cases of like nature. For so we see in the book which „Q Ci-
cero writeth to his brother, ‘De petitione confidam, (being the only book of
bufiucss that I know written by the ancients) although it concerned a parti·
eular aciion then on foot, yet the substance thereof consisteth of many wisc
and politick axioms, ‘which contain not a temporary, but a perpetual direc-
tion in the case of popular eleffions ,- but chicflywc may see in those apho-
risms which have place amongst divine writings composed by Solomon the
king, of whom the scriptures testify, that his hear-t was as the ›sands of the
sea, encompassmg the world, and all worldly matters z we sec, Ι say, not a
few profound and excellent cautious, precepts, pofitions, extending to much
variety of occasions3 whereupon we will stay a while, offering to considera-
tion somc number of exampleS. - ’ ¹
