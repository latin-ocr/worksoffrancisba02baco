partly converteth nature; and poison is that which worke'th wholly upon
nature, without that, that nature can in any part work upon it: So in the
mind whatsoever knowledge reason cannot at all work upon and 60111611,- is
a mere intoxication, and indangereth a difl'olution of the mind* and ‘undet-
standing. . Δ

Bur for the later, it hath been extremely set on foot of lare time bythe
school of Paracelfizs, and some others that have pretended ro find the truth‘
of all natural philosophy in the scriptures3 scandalizing and traducing-an
other philosophy as heathenish and prophane. But there is no such enmity
between God's word and his works: Neither do they give honour to the
scripture, as they suppose, but much embase them. For to secl< heaven and
earth in the word of God, whereof it is said, heaven and earth fhall past,
but my word shall not past, is to seek temporary things amongst eternal:
and asto seek divinity in philosophy is to seek the living amongst the dead,
so to secl< philosophy in divinity is to seek the dead amongst the living3 nei-
ther are the pots or lavers, whose place was in the outward part of the tem-
ple, to be fought in the holiest place of all, where the ark of the testimony
was seated. And again, the scope or purpose of the Spirit of (iod is notro
express matters of nature in the scriptures, otherwise than in passage, and for
application to man's capacity and to matters moral or divine. And it is a
truc rule, Authorl's allud agentis parvaautlooritas: for it wcreastrange con-
clufion, if a man should use a fimilitude for ornament or illustration sake,
borrowcd from nature or history, according to vulgar conceir, as of a bafi-
lisk, an unicorn‚ acentaure, aBriareus‚ an Hydra, or the like, that there-
fore he must needs be thought to affirm the matter thereos pofitively to be
true. To conclude therefore these two interpr-cranous, the one by seduction
or aenigmatical, the other philosophical or physical, which have been re-
ceived and pursued in imitation of the rabbins and cabalistS, are to bc con-
fined with a noli altum fiz ere,de time}

Bur the two later points known to God, and unknown to man, touch-
i-ng the secrets of the heart, and the successions of time, do make a just·
and sound differ-enee between the manner of the exposition of the seriptures,
and all other books. For it is an excellent observation which harh been
made upon the answers of our Saviour Christ, to many of the questions
which were propounded to him, how that they are impertinent to the
state of the question demandetis the reason whereof is, because not being
like man, which knows man's thoughts by his words, but knowing man’s·
thoughts immediately, he never answered their words but their thoughts:
much in the like manner it is with the scriptur-es, which being written to‘
the thoughts of men, and to the suecession of all ages, with a forefight of
all herclies‚ c'ontradiclions, differing estates of the church, yea, and parti·
cularly of the elect, are not to be interpreted only according to the latitude
of the proper sense of the place, and relpeffively towards that present oc-
caston, whereupon the words were uttered‚ 01111 precise congruity or con-
texture with the words before or after, or in contemplation of the principal
scope of the places but have in themselves not only totally or colleffiively‚
but distributively in clauses and words infinite springs and streams of doc-
trine to water the church in every part3 and therefore as the literal sense
is as it were the main stream or river, so the moral sense chiefly, and
sometimes the allegorical or typical‚ are they whereof the clun-ch bath.
