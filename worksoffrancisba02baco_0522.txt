508 OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookn.

that he should not hazard himself to sea in an extremity of weathcr, he said
only to them, N ecesse est nt eam, non nt vivam .· But it may be truly affirm-
ed that there was never any philosophy, religion, or other discipline, which
did so plainly and highly exalt the good which is communicative, and depress
the good which is private and particular, as the holy saith: well declaring,
thafit was the same God that gave the christian law to men, who gave those
laws of nature to inanimate creatures that we'spake of before ,- for we read
that the eleeied saints of God have wished themselves anathematized and
razed out of the book of life, in an ecstasy of clm-ity, and infinite feeling of
communion.

THIS being set down and strongly planted, doth judge and determine
most of the cbntroversscs wherein moral philosophy is conversant. For first,
it decideth the question touching the preferment of the contemplative or
aetive life, and decideth it against Aristotle: for all the reasons which he
brings for the contemplative are private, and respecting the pleasure and dig-
'nity of a man's self (in which respecfflS, no question, the contemplative life
hath the preheminencez) not much unlike to thar comparison, which Py-
thagoras made for the gracing and magnifying of philosophy and contem-
plati0n5 who being asked what he¹ was, answered, “ That if Hiero were
“ ever at the Olympiam games, he knew the manner, that some came to try
“ their fortunefor the prize5, and some came as merchants to utter their
‘⁶ commodities, and some came to make good cheer and meet their friends,
‘⁶ and some came to look on, and that he was one of them that came to
“ look on.’' But men must know, that in this theatrc of man's life, itis re-
served only for God and angels to be lookers on: neither could. the like
question ever have becn received in the Church, notwithstanding their pre-
tiosa in oculis ‘Domz'ni mors fimHorum ejus 5 by which place they would
exalt their civil death and regular professions, but upon this defence, that the
monaffical life is not simply contemplative, but performeth the duty either
of incestant prayers and supplications, which harh been truly esteemed as an
office in the church, or else of writing or taking instructions for writing con-
cerning the law of God ,- as Mofhs did when he abodc so long in the mount.
And so we see Enoch the seventh from Adam, who was the first contempla-
tive and walked with God3 yet did also endow the Church with prophecy,
which St. Jude citeth. But for contemplation, which lhould be finilhed in
it sclf, without casting beams upon society, ass'uredly divinity knoweth it
not.

IT decideth also the controversies between Zeno and Socrates, and their
schools and succeffions on the one fide, who placed felicity in virtue simply
or attended5 the a&i01is and exercises whereof do chiefly embrace and con—
cern society3 ancl on the other fide, the Cyrenaicks and Epicuream, who
placed it in pleasure, and made virtue (as it is used in some comedies of er· ,
rors, wherein the mistress and the maid change habits) to be but as a servant
without which pleasure cannot be served and attendcd, and th'e rcformed
school of the Epicuream, which placed it in sereniry of mind and free-
dom from perturbati0n3 as if they would have deposed Jupiter again, and
restored Saturn and the first age, when there was no summer nor winter,
spring nor autumn, but all after one air and season. And Herillus, which
placed felicity in extinguilhment of the disputes of the mind, making
no fixed nature of good and evil, esteeming things according to the
clcarness of the defu-cs, or the reluCtati0n3 which opinion was revived in
the heresy of the anabaptistS, measuring things according to the motions os
