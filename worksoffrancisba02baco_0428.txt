OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookr,

this tabernacle of the body are sequestred) again rcvived and restored: Such
a light of nature lhave observed in your majesty, and such a readiness to
take flame, and blaze from the least occasion presented, or the least spark
of another-'s knowledge delivered. And as the scripture saith of the wisest
king, That his beart was as the jands os thesea ‚- which though ir be one ot*
the largest bodies, yet it confisteth of the smallest and finest portions: so
hath God given your majesty a composition of understanding admirable,
being able to eompass and comprehend the greatest matters, and neverthe-
less to touch and apprehend the least3 whereas it should seem an imposti-
bility in nature, for the same instrument to make it self fit for great ‚aud
small works. And for your gift of speech, Icall to mind what Cornidius
Tacitus saith of Augustus Caesar ς Angrisloprqffitens, &quae principem dice-
ret, eloquentia fuit .· For if we note it well, speech thatis uttered with labour
and difficulty, or speech that savoureth of the affeeiation of art and prc-
ccpts, or speech that is framcd after the imitation of some pattern of elo-
quenoe, though never so excellent3 all this bath somewhat servile, and hold-
ing of the subject. But your majesty's manner of speech is indeed prince-
like, flowing as from a fountain, and yet streaming and branehing ir selfin-
to nature's order, fullof facility and felicity, imitating none, and inimitable
by any. And as in your civil estate there appeareth to be an emulation
and contentiori of your majesty's virtue with your fortune, a virtuous dispo
sirion witha fortunate regimem-2 a virtuous expeoation (when rime was>
of your greater fortune, with a prosperous poss'cssion thereof in the due
time; a virtuous observation of the laws of marriage, with most bleffed
and happy fruit of marriage3 a virtuous and most christian desire of peace,
with a fortunate inclination in your neighbour princes thereunto: So like-
wisc in these intellectual matters, there seemerh to be no less contention be-
tween the excellency of your majesty’s gifts of nature, and the universality

. and perfeffion of your learning. Forl am well affurcd, that this which Ι>

shall say is no amplification at all, but a positive and measured truth3
which is, that there hath not been fince Christ's time any king or tempor-al ⁴
monarch which hath been so learned in all literature and crudition, divine
and humane. For let a man scrioussy and diligently revolve and pei-use the
succeffion of the emperors of Rome, of which Caesar the dictator, who li-
ved some years before Christ, and Marcus Antoninus were the best learned5
and so descend to the emperors of Graecia, or of the west3 and then to
the lines of France, Spain, England, scotland, and the rest, and he shall
find this judgmcnt is truly made. For it seemeth much in a king, if by the
compendious extraffions of other mens wits and labourS, he can take hold
of any superficial ornaments and shews of learning, or if he countenance
and prefer learning and learned men ι But to drink indeed of the true foun-
tains of learning3 nay‚ to have such a fountain of learning in himself, in a
king, and in a king born, is almost a miracle. And the more, because
there is met in your majesty a rare conjunctim, as wcll of divine and sa-
cred literature, as of prophane and human: so as your majesty standeth ine
vested of that triplicity‚ which in great veneration was ascribed to the an-
cient Hermen the power and fortune of a king, the knowledge and illumi·
nation of a priest, and the learning and universality of a philosopher. This
propriety, inherent and individua} attribute in your majesty, deserveth to bc
cxpmffed, not only in the farne and admiration of the ,present time, nor in
the history or tradition of the ages succceding3 but also in some solid work,
fixed memorial, and immortal monument, bearing a character or signa—

ture,
