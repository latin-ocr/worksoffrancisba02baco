the knowledge with the deficiences be twenty, the parts of fifteen arc not
the parts of twenty, for the parts of fifteen are three and five, the parts of
twenty are two, four, five and tcn ,ς so as these things arc without contradic-
tion and could not otherwise be.

WE proceed now to that knowledge which confidereth of the appetite

and will of man, whereof Salomon saith, Ante omnia, fili, custod) cor tuum,
nam inde procedunt actiones vitae. ln the handling of this seience, those
which have written seem to rne to have done as if a man that profess'cd to
teach to write, did only exhibit fair copies of alphabetS, and letters joined,
without giving any precepts or directions for the carriage of the hand and
framing of the letters ‚- so have they made good and fair exemplars and. copies,
carrying the dtaughts and pourtraitures of good, virtue, duty, felicity ,- pro-
pounding thern well described as the true objeets and scopes of man's will and
defires3 but how to attain these excellent marks, and how to frame and sub-
due the will of man to become true and conformable to these pursuits‚ they
pass it over altogether, or ssightly and unprofitably3 for it is not the disput-
ting> that moral virtues are in the mind of man by habit and not by nature,
or the distinguiihing that *generous spirits are won by do&ri11es and persua-
smus, ancl the vulgar sort by reward and punishment, and the like scattered
clances and touchcs, that can excuse the absence of this part.
D T H E reason of this omiffion 1 suppose to be that hiddcn rock whereupon
both this and many other barks of knowledge have been cast away3 which is,
that men have despised to be conversam in ordinary and common matterS, the
judicious direction whereof nevcrtheless is the wisest doctrine3 (for life con-
fisteth not in novelties nor subtilities) but contrariwilefltheyhave'compounded
sciences chiefly of a certain resplendent or lustrous mass of matter, chosen to
give glor-y eitherto thesubtlctyofdisputations, or'to the eloquence ofdiscourses.
But Seneca giveth an excellent check to eloquence: Nocet illis eloquentia,
quibus non rerum cupiditatem facit, βτί sici: Doctrine lhould be such as
ihould make men in love with the leffon, and not with the teachcr, being di-
tested to the auditor's benefit‚ and not to the author's commendation ς and
therefore those are of the right kind which may be concluded as Demosthe-
nes concludes his counsel, Quae st feceritis, non oratorem duntaxat in
praesentia laudabitis, sed vosmetzpsos etiam, non ita multo post statu rerum
vestrarum meliore. N either needed men of so excellent parts to have despair·
ed of a fortune, (which the poet Virgil promised himself, and indeed ob-
tained) who got as much glory of eloquence, wit, and learning in the express
{ing of the observations of husbandry, as of the heroical aeas of AEneas .-

Nec ficm animi dubius, verbis ea vincere magnum
Qum stt, ὠ *angustis hunc addere rebus honorem. Georg. iii. 2 89.

'A N D surely if the purpose bein good earnest not to write at leisure that
Which men may read at leisure, but really to instruet ancl suborn action and
active life, these georgics of the mind concerning the husbandry and tillage
thereos, ate no less worthy than the heroical descriptions of virtue, duty, and
felicity3 wherefore the main and primitive division of moral knowledge
seemeth to be into the exemplar or platform of good, and the regiment or
culture of the mind÷ the one describing the nature of good, the other pre-
scribing mles how to subdue, apply and accommodate the will of man there-
lanto.
