A No r H E n precept os this knowledge is to imitare nature, which doth
nothing in vain, which surely a man may do if hc do well interlacc his busi—
ncss, and bend nor his mind too much upon thar which hc principally intend-
cd. For a man ought in every particular action so to carry the motions of
his mind, and so to have one thing under another, as if he cannot have that
he seekcth in the best degree, yet to have it in a second, οἰ· so in a third 3 and
ifhe can have no part of that which he purposed, yet to turn rhe use of it to
somewhat else3 and if he cannot make any thing of it for the present, yet
to make it as a seed of somewhat in time to come3 and ifhe can contrivc no
effe& or substance from it, yet to tuin some good opinion by it, or the
1ike3 so that he lhould exac't an account of himselfof every ac'lion, to reap
somewhat, and not to stand amazed and confused if he fail of that he chiefly
meant : for nothing is more impolitick than to mind aetions wholly
one by one. For he that doth sO, loserh infinite occasions which inter-
vene, and are many times more proper and propitious for somewhat that hc
shall need afterwards, than for that which he urgeth for the present ς and

therefore men must be perfect in that rule, Ilaec oportet facere, ,dy illa
Α non omzttere.

A No T H ER precept of this knowledge is, not to ingage a man's self pe-
remptorily in any thing, though it seem not liable to accident, but everto
have a wiudow to flie out at, or a way to retire, following the wisdom in
the ancient fable of the two frogs, which consultcd when their plalh was dry
whither they {hould go, and the one moved to go down into a pit, because
it was not likely the water would dry there, but the other answered, ‘⁴ True,
“ but if it do, how shall we get out again ?'’

ANo THER precept of this knowledge is, that ancient precept of Bias,
construed not to any point of perfidiousness, but only to cantion and modera-
tion, Et ama tanquam inimicus futurus, (ἐν odi tanquam amaturus .· for it
utterly betrayeth all utility‚ for men to imbark themselves too far into un-
fortunate friendssiips‚troublesome spleem, and childish and humourous envies
or emulations.

ΒΗΤ Ι cont‘inue this beyond the measure of an example, led, because I
would not have such knowledges which I note as deficient, to be thought
things imaginative, or in the air3 or an observation or two, much made of,
but things of bulk and mass ς whereof an end is hardlier made than a be-
ginning. It must be likewise conceived that in those points which Ι men-
tion and set down, they are far from compleat trastates of thern, but only
as small pieces for patterns: And lastly, no man Ι suppose will think, that Ι
mean fortunes are not obtained without all this ado, for 1 know they come
tumbling into some mens laps, and a number obtain good fortunes by dili-
genee in a plain way, little intermeddling‚ and keeping themselves from gross
errorS.

Bur as Cicero when he setteth down an idea of a perfect orator, doth
not mean that every pleader should be such3 and so likewise‚ when a prince
or a courtier harh been described by such as have handled those subjeets, the
mould harh used to be made according to the perfeffion of the art, and not
according to common practice: so 1 understand it, that it ought to be
done in the description of a politick man, Ι mean politick for his own
fortune. Ι

Bur it must be remembred all this while, that the precepts which we

have setdown are of that kind which may be counted and called bonae artes :-
