power3 and the second is accidenta13 the third only is proper to be hancl-

led: but because we are not in hand with true measure, hut with popular
estimation and conceit, it is not amis> to speak rbmcwlmt os the two
former. The derogations therefore, which grow to learning from the for-
tune or condition of learned men, are either in respect of sear-city of
means, or in respect of privateness of life, and meanness of employ-
ments.

CONCERN ING want, and that it is the case of learned men usually to be-
gin with little, and not to grow rich so fast as other men, by reason they
convert not their labours chiefly to lucre and increase: lt were good to
leave the common place in commendation of poverty to some friar to han-
dle, to whom much was attributed by Musam-vel in this point3 when he
said, “ That the kingdom of the clergy had been long before at an end, is
‘⁶ the reputation and reverence towards the poverty of friars had not horn
“ out the scandal of the superfluities and excelles of hilhops and prelates.²'
So a man might say, that the felicity and delicacy of princes and great per-
sons, had long fince turned to rudeness and barbarism, if the poverty os
learning had not kept up civility and honour of life: but without any such
advantages‚ it is worthy the observation, what a reverend and honoured
thing poverty of fortune wa5, for some ages in the Roman state, which ne—
vertheless was a state without paradoxes. For we see what T ltus Livius
saith in his introduftion: Caeterum aut me amor negotii sttfivptjfizllit, aut
nulla unquamresl'oublica, nec major, necfizchjor, uec bonis exemplis ditior
fitit5 nec in quam tam serae avaritia luxuriaque imngraverint3 necubi
tantus ac tam diu paupertati acparfimom'ae honos fuerit. W e¹ see likewise af-
ter that the state of Rome was not it self, but did degenerate3 how that per-
son that took upon him to be counsellor to Julius Caefizr, after his victory,
where to begin his restoration of the state, maketh it of all points the most
summary to take away the estimation of wealth. V erum haec& omnia ma-
la pariter cum honore pecuniae defluent st neque magistratus, neque alja vulgo
cupienda, vaenalia erunt. To conclude this point, as it was truly said, that
rubor est virtutis color, though sometime it come from vice: so it may be
fitly said, that paupertas est virtutis fortuna3 though sometimes it may
proceed from milgovernment ancl accident. Surely Salomon harh pronoun-
cedit both in censure, Qifcstinat ad divitias non erit in σφω-,- and in pre-
cept3 “ Buy the trurh, and sell it not;” and so of wisdom and knowledge3
judging that means were to be spent upon learning, and not learning to bc
applied to means. And as for the privateness or obscureness (as it may be
in vulgar estimation accounted) of life of contemplative men3 it is a theme
so common, to extol a private life, not taxed with sensuality and ssoth in
comparffon, and to the disadvantage of a civil life, for safety, liberty, plea-
sure and dignsty, or at least freedom from indignity, as no man handleth
it, but handleth it well: such a consonaney it harh to mens eonceits in the
cxpreffing, and to mens consents in the allowing. This only Iwill add,
that learned men, forgotten in states, and not living in the eyes of men, are
like the images of Caffius and Brutus in the funeral of Junia ,- of which not
being represented, as many others were, Tacitus saith, Eo jpsb praefulgebant,
quod non vzfibantur.

AND for the meanness of cmployment, that which is most traduced to
contempt, is, that the government of youth is commonly allotted to thenu
which age, because it is the age of least authority, it is transferred to the
disesteeming of those employments wherein youth is conversam, and which
