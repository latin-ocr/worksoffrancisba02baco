enquirers into truth‚ but will despise those delicacies and affcfflons, asin-
deed capable of no divincncss. And thus much ofthe first discase or distemper
oflearning, 7

THE second which followeth, is in nature worse than the forn-legg.
foras substance of matter is better than beauty of wordS, so contrariwise
vain matter is worse than vain wordsz wherein it seemeth the reprehen-
fion of St. Paul, was not only proper for those times, but prophetical fot
the times following3 and not only respestive to divinity, but extensive to all
knowledge: Det-ita prophanas vocum novitates c} oppqfftionesfalfi' nominis
scientiae. For he assigneth two marks and badgcs of suspe&ed and falfificd

‘sciencet the one, the novelty and strangcncss of terms; the other, the

strit'tness of politions, which of neceflity doth induce oppositions‚ and so
questions and altercationS. Surely like as many substances in nature which
are solid, do putrefy and corrupt into wormsz so it is the propriety of good
and found knowledge, to putrefy and dissolve into a number of subtlc, idle,
unwholesome, ancl (asImayterm thern) ‚vermiculate questions, which have
indeed a kind of quickness, and life of spirit, but no soundness of matter,
or goodness of quality. This kind of degenerare learning did chiefly reign
amongst the school-men, who having {harp and strong wits, and abun-
dance of leisurc, and small variety of reading3 but their wits being {hut
up in the cells of a few authors (chiefly Argstotle their dictator) as their per-
sons were {hut up in the cells of monaster-‘ies and cosseges, and knowing lir-
tle history, either of nature or time, did out of no great quantity of mat-
ter, and infinite agitation of wit, spin out unto us those laborious webs of
learning, which are extant in their books. For the wit and mind of man,
if it work upon matter, which is the contemplation of the ereatures of God,
worketh according ro the stuff, and is limitcd thereby: but if it work up-
on it self, as the spider worketh his web, thenit is endless and brings forth
indeed cobwebs of learning, admirable for the finencss of thread and work,
but of no substance or profit.

THIS sanw unprofitable subtility or curiosity is of two sorts; either in
the subjeci: it sclf that they handle, when it is fruitless speculation or contro-
versy, (whereof there are no small number both in divinity and philoso-
phy 3) or in the manner or method of handling of a knowledge, which a·
mongst them was this; upon every particular position or afl'ertion to framc
objeciions, and to those objefflons, solutions; which solutions were for the
most part not confutations, but distinctions whereas indeed the strength of
all itionem, is as the strength of the old man’s saggot in the band. For the
harmony of a science supporting each part the other, is and ought robe
the true and brief confutation and. suppress'ron of all the smaller sort of ob-
jeffions. Bur on the other fide, if you take out every axiom, as the sticks
ofthe faggot one by one, you may quarrel with them, and bend them and
break them at your pleasure: so that as was said of Seneca, Verborum minu-
tiis rerum frangit pondera: So a man may truly say of the school-rnen,
⁴Quaestionum minutas scientiarum frangunt sblidt'tatem. For were it not bct-
ter fora man in a fair room, to set up one great light, or branching ean-
dlestick of lightS, than to go about with a small warch candle into every
corner? And such is their method, that rests not so much upon evidence
of truth proved by arguments, authorities, similitudes, examplcs, as upon
particular confutations and solutions of every scruple, cavillation and obiec-
tiO113 brceding for the most part one question, as fast as it solvctli ano-

'ther5 even as in the former resemblance, when yon carry the light into
