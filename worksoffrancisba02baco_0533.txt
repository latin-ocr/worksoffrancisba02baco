is it not true also, that much less young 111611 316 fit auditors of matters of
policy, till they have been throughly scafoned in religion and morality, lest
their judgmcnts be corrupted, and made apt to think that there are no true
differenccs ot' things, but according to utility and fortune, as the verse de-
scribes it ἒ

‘Prosperum O· filix scelus virtus vocatur.

And again,
Ille crucem pretium sceleris tulit, hic diadema .·

which the poets do speak satirically, and in indignation on vittue’s bchalf :
but books of policy do speak it serioussy and posstixelys for so it pleaseth
Machiavel to say, “ That if Caefizr had been overthrown, 116 would have
‘⁴ been more odious than ever was Catiline: ’' as if there had been no dif-
fcrence but in fortune, between a very fury of lust and blood, and the most
excellent spirit (his ambition rescrved) of the world? Again, is there not a
caution likewise to be given of the (1061111165 of moralitics themselves (101116
kinds of them) lest they make 111611 100 precise, arrogant, incompatible‚ as

' · Cicero saith of Cato in Marco Catone : Haec bona qnae videmus divina ὠ·

egregia ipfins fiitote cffb propria: quae nonnunquam requirimus, ea fitnt
omnia, non a natura, ſsd a magssro ? Many other axioms and advices there
are touching those proprieties and effodis, Which studies do infuse and instil
into manners. And so likewise is there touching the use of all those 011161·
points of company, fame, laws, and the rest, which we recited in the begin-
ning in the 1106111116 of morality.

B UT there is a kind of culture of the mind that seemeth yet more accurate
and elaborate than the rest, and is built upon this ground: That the minds
of all rnen are sometimes in a 11316 111016 perfect, and 31 011161 1111165 111 311316
more depraved. The purpose therefore of this practice, is to fix and 611611111
1116 good hours of the mind, and to obliterate and. take forth the evil.
Ι The fixing of the good 113111 been praffised by two 11163115, vows or con-
stant resolutioris, and observances or 6116161165, which are not to be regarded
so much in themselves, as because they keep the mind in continual obedi-
cnee. The obliteration of the evil harh been praeiised by two means, some
kind of redemption or expiation of that which is past, and an inception 01
account de novo, for the time to come : but this part seemeth sacred and re-
ligiouS, ancl 111111)γ 5 fot all good moral philosophy (as was said) is but an
handmaid to religion.

W H E RE F 0 R E we will conclude with that last point, which is of all other
means the most compendious and summary; and again, the most noble and
6116611131 10 1116 reducing of the mind unto virtue and good estate ‚- which is
the eleeting and propounding unto a man’s self good ancl virtuous ends of
his life, such as may be in a reasonable sort within his eompass to attain.
For if these two things be‘supposed‚ that a man set before him honest and
good ends, and again that he be resolute, constant, and true unto them ς it
will follow, 111311161113111110111111111111611 into 311 virtue at once3 and this is
indeed like 1116 work of nature, Whereas the‘ other course is like the work
of⁴ the hand. Por as when a carvcr makes an image, hc ffiapes only that
part whereupon he workct'n‚ 35 if 116 be upon the face, that part which 111311
be the body is but 3 rude stone still, till such time as 116 comes to it. But
contrarywise‚ when nature makes a flower or living creature, 1116 formeth

rudiments of all 1116 parts 31 one time: so in obtaining virtue by halbilt,
