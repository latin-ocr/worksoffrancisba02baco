the second part of the certificate against Smithwicke, and the first part
which was formerly decreed for him, his lordship made doubtful: Smjth‘-
wicke petition'd to the lord chan'ccllor for his money again, and smith-
wicke had all his money, save 20l„ kept back by Ham for a year.

Tm: lord chief justice also delivered three petitions, which his lordssiip
received yesterday from the commons: The first by the lady llshartoii, the
second by Wood and ‘Patjetor and others, and the third by sz'thwz'cke.

THE fourth part of the messhge consists only of instructions delivered
unto the commons by one Charchill a register, containing divers bribcs and
abuses in the chancery, which the commons desire may be examincd.

THE lords, in the mean time, proceed'ed to the examination of the com·

plaintS, and took divers examinationis of witness'es in the house, and appointed
avsel'ec‘c- 'committee of themselves to take examinations also.
, Anu on lVednes'dqy the twenty fourth of April, the prince his highness,
fignified uuto their lordships, that the said lord chaneellot had sent a sub-
miffion unto their lordssiips, which was presently read 111 haec verba, viz.
Von.1V.p. 688. ’ ,

THE lords having confidered of this fiibmission„and heard the col-
lefflons of corruptions charged upon the said lord chancellor, and the
proofs thereof read, they sent a copy of the same without the proofs unto
him the said l0td chaneellor, by Mr. Baton Denloam, aud Mr. Attorney ge·
neraL with this meffage from their lordships‚ viz. That the lord chan-
cellor’s confeffion is not. fully set down by his lordship iu the said submis-
·fion, for three causes. Ἴ t

1. F IRST his lordlhip confess'eth not any particular bribe or corruption}¹

2. N OR lheweth how hisloi-dffiip heard the charge thereos.

3. THE eonfeffiom such as it is,·is afterwards, extenuated in the same
submiffions and therefore the lords have sent him a particular of the
-ch‘arge, and do expe& his answer to the same with all convenient cx-
pedition. , ,

UNTo which meffage the lord chancellor answeted, that he would re-
tutu the lords an answer with speed.

AND on the twenty fifth of April the lords considered of the lot-d chan-
cellot's said answer, sent unto their message yesterday, and senta second
meffige unto his lordship to this effect, by the said Mr. Baron Denham, and
Mr.Attorney general, viz. The lordshaving reccivedadoubtful answer unt'o
the mcss‘age their lordships sent him yesterday, and⁴ therefore thcynow
. sen'd to him again to know of his lordship, dii-cecly and presently, whether
his lordship will make his confeffion, or stand upon his defence. ¹

ANSWER returned by the said mell'enger-s, viz. The 10111 chaneellor will
make no manner of defence to the charge, but meaneth to acknowledge
corruption, aud to make a particular confess'ton to eyery point, and aster
that an humble submiffiom ‘bnt humbly eraves liberty, that where the
charge is more full than he finds the truth of the fact, he may make de-
claration of the truth 111 such particulam, the charge being brief, and con-
taining not all circumstances. ,

THE lords seut the same mess'engers back again 1ο the iord chaneellor,
to let him know, that their lordlhips have granted him time until monday
next, the *thirtieth of April, by ten 111 the morning, to send such con-

feffion and submiss'ton as his lordlhip intends to make. O ἢ.
