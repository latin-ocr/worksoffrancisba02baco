pi·inciplcs; 31111 of that other part of natural philosophy, which eonc‘e'rn'!
eth the soul or spirit, all these strangcly commixed 31111 confused: but being
examined, it seemeth to 1116 rather 3 depredation of other sciences, adyaiic'e'c‘s
31111 exalted 111110 some height of termS, than any thing solid or substantive
of it self.

N EVERTHELESS Icannot be ignorant. of the distintiion which is cur-
rent, that 1116131116 things are handled but in several respects. As'for
example, that logick confidereth of many things 33 they 316111 110110115 and
this philosophy, 33 they are in nature3 the one in appearance, the other'hi
existence: butI find this difference 0611611113116 111311 pursued. For if they
had considered quantity, similitude, diversity, 31111 the rest of those exteni-
charaCters of things, as pliilolopliei·5‚ and in naturc; their enquiries must
of force have been of afar other kind 111311 they are.

FOR doth any ofthem in handling quantity, speak of the force ofunion,
how, and how far it multiplieth virtue? Doth any give the reason, Why
some things in 11311116 316 so common and in so great mass, and others so¹
rare, 31111 in so small quantity? Doth any, in handling similitude 31111 diver-
fity, assi gn the cause why iron should 1101 move 10 11011, which is more like,
but move to the loadstone, which is less like? Why in all diverfities of
things there should be certain participles in nature, which 316 almost am-=
biguous, to which kind they should bc referred? But there is 3 111616 31111
deep silence, touching the nature 31111 operation of those common adjunits
of things, as in nature, and only 3 resuming 31111 repeating of the force and
use of them, in speech or argument. ·

THEREFORE because in 3 writing of this nature Ι avoid all subtilty, my
meaning touching this original 01 universal philosophy, is thus in a plain
and gross description by negative3 ‘⁴ That it 06 3 receptacle for all such
“ profitable observations and axioms, as fall not within the compass of any
‘⁶ of the special parts of philosophy or scienccs, but 316 111016 common, and
‘⁶ of 3 higher stage.”

Now that there 316 many of that kind, need not to be doubted. For ex-
ample3 is not the rule, Si inaequalibus aequalia addas, omnia erunt inae-
qualia, 311 axiom as well of justice as of the niatheniaticks? And is there
not 3 11116 coincidence between commutative and distributive justice, and
arithmetical 31111 geometricalproportion? Is not that other 11116, ‘Quaem eo-
dem tertio conveniunt, όν inter st conveniunt, 3 11116 1316611 from the mathe-
1113116163, but so potent in logick‚ 33 311 syllogismis are built upon it? Is not
the obser-vatim, Omnia mutantur, nil interit, acontemplation in philosophy
111113, 11131 the quantum of nature 13 61611131; 111 natural theology thus3 that
it requireth the same omnipotcncc to make somewhat nothing, which at
the first made nothing somewhat? According to the scripture, ‘Didici quod
omnia opera quae fecit Dens, perseverent inperpetuums non poffitmus eis
quicquam addere, nec auferre.

Is not the ground which Machiavel wisely and largely discourseth con-
cerning governmentS, that the way to 6113011111 31111 preserve them, 13 to re-
duce them adprincipias 3 11116 111 religion and nature, as well asin 61ν11 ad-
ministration? was not the Persian magick a 1611116ὶί1311 01· correspondence of
the principles and 316111166111163 of nature, to the rules 31111 policy of go-
vernments? Is not the precept of 3 111111161311, to fallssfrom a discord or 1131111
3660111, upon a concord 01 sweet accord, alike true in affcCtion? Is not the
trope of musiek, to avoid or ssidc from the. close of cadence, common with
