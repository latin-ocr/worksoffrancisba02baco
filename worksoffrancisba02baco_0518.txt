OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookll.

1³ 0R Mu L A E are but decent and apt pass'ages or convenienees of speech,
which may serve indifferently for differing iiibjcec53 as of preface, cone-luston,
digreffion, transition, excusation, &a For as in buildings there is great plea-
surc and use in ⁴the well easting of the stair-eases, entries, doors, windows, and

‘the like; so in speech, the eonveyanccs and paffages are of special ornament

and effect
A concluston in a deliberati-ve.

‘⁶ So may we. redeem the faults pass'ed, and prevent the inconveniencies fu-
“ ture.”

T H E R E remain two appendixes touehing the tradition of knowledge, the
one critical, the other pedantica13 for all knowledge is either delivered by
teachers‚ or attained by mens proper endeavours: And therefore as the
prineipal part of tradition {of knowledge concerneth chiefly wriring of
books, so the relative part thereof concerneth reading of books: where-nuto
appertain incidently these considerations. The first is concerning the true
eorreffion and edition of authors, wherein nevertheless ralh diligence
harh done great prejudice. For these critieks have often presumed that
that which they understand not, is false set down. As the priest, that
where he found it written of St. Paul, Demtffus cst per sportam, mend-
cd his book, and made it demiffits est per portam, because sporta was an
hard word, and out of his reading ε and surely their errors, though they be
not-so palpable and ridiculous, yet are of the lame kind. And therefore :rs
it harh been wisely noted, the most corrected copies are commonly the least
coi-rest.

THE second is eoncerning the exposition and explicatior] ofamhors, which
resteth in annotations and commentaries, wherein it is over usual to blanch
the obscure places and discourse upon the plain.

THE third is concerning the times, which in many cases give great light
to true interpretation&

THE fourth is vconcerning some brief censure and judgrnent o‘r' the au-
thor’s,that men thereby may makesome cleeiion unto themselves what books
to read.

A N D the fifth is coneerning the syntax and disposition of studies, that men
may know in what order or pursuit to read.

FOR pedantieal knowledge, it containeth that difference of tradition
which is proper for youth, whereunto appertain divers considerations of
great fruit.

A s first the timing and seasoning of knowledges3 as with what to initiate
them, and from what for a time to refrain them.

SECONDLY, the consideration where to begin with the eafiest, and so
procced to the more difficult, and in what courses to press the more diffi-
cult, and then to turn thern to the more easy 3 for it is one method to prac-
tise swimining with bladdcrs, and another to praelise dancing with heavy
ssioes.

A ΤΗ 1R D is the applicarion of learning according unto the propriery of
the wits; foi· there is no defeest in the saculties intelleeiual but seemeth to
have a proper cure contained in some studies: as sor example, if a child be
birdwitted, that iS, harh not the fiiculty of attention, the mathematicks
givetha remedy thereunro, sor in them is the wit be caught away bnt a
moment, one is new to begin: and as seiences have a propriety towards fa·
culties for cure and help, so faculties or powers have a sympathy towards

leienccs
