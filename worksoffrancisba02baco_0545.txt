Bookll. OF LEARNING.

is a great advantage in the well setting forth ofa man's virtues, fortunes, mc-
rit83 and again, in the artificial covering of a man's weakness, tlt-fecis, dis-
graces, stay-ing upon the one, sliding from the other 3 cherishing the one by
circumstances, gracing the other by exposition, and the likes wherein wc see
what Tsszcs'tns saith of Medianas, who was the greatest politieian of his
time, Omnium, quae dixerat, firmatque, arte quadam (gll‘entatom which rc-
quireth indeed some art, lest it turn tedious and arrogant3 but yet so, as
ostentation (though it bc to the first degree of vanity) seemeth to mc rather
a vice in manners than in policy: for as it is laid, Andaft'er calumniare,
fi’mper aliquid haeret ‚- so except it be in a ridiculous degree of deformity,
Audaft'er te vendita, stmper aliquid haeret. For it will stiek with the
more ignorant and infe-rior sort ofmen, though men of wisdom and rank
do smile at it, and despire it 3 and yet the authority won with many, doth
countetvail the disdain of a few. But if it be carried with deccncy and go-
vernment, as with a natural, pleasant and ingenuous faihion, or at times when
it is mix’d with some peril and unsafety‚ (as in military persons,) or at times
when others are most envied3 or with easy and careless passage to it and from
it, without dwclling too long, or being too serious; or with an equal
freedom of taxing a man's self, as well as gracing himself, or by occasion
of repelling or putting down others injury or insolence, it doth greatly add
to reputatiom and surely not a few solid natures that want this ventofity‚
and cannot sail in the height of the wind5‚ are not without some prejudice
and disadvantagc by their moderation.

B UT for these flourilhes and enhancements of virtue, as they are not per«
chance unneccffary, so it is at least necessary that virtue bc not disvalued and
imbased under the just price, which is done in three manners ,- by offering
and obtruding a man's sclf, wherein men think he is rewarded, when he is
accepted : By doing too much, which will not give that which is well done
leave to settle, and in the end induceth satiety: and by finding too soon the
fruit of a man's virtue, in commendation, applause, honour, favour 5 where-
in if a man be pleased with a little, let him hear what is truly vsaid ,-
Cave ne infitetus rebus mqjoribus videaris, si haec te res parva, flenti
magna, deleeffat.

Bur the covering of defeets is of no less importance than the valuing
of good parts ε’ which may be done likewise in three manners, by cantion, by
colour, and by confidence. Caution is, when men do ingenioussy and dis-
creetly avoid to be put into those things for which they are not? proper:
whereas contrariwise, bold and unquiet spirits will thrust themselves into
matters without difference, and so publilh and proclaim all their wants ,- co-
lour is when men make a way for themselves, to have a construerion made of
their faults or wants3 as proceeding from a better cause, or intended for some

other purpose: for of the one it is well said,
Saepe latet vitium proximitate boni.

And therefore whatsoever want a man harh, he must see that he pretend
the virtue that shadoweth it3 as if he be dull, he must affe& gravity ς if a
coward‚ mildness; and so the rest. For the second, a man must frame
some probable cause why he ssiould not do his best, and why he should dis-
semble his abilities ,ς and for that purpose must use to diffemble those abi-
lities, which are notorious in him to give colour, that his true w-ants are
but industries and diffimulations: for confidence it is 'the last, but surest re-
