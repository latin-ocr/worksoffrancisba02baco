the openness of the world by navigation, which harh disclosed multltndes
of experiments, and a mass of natural history: the lcisurc whcrcwith these
times abound, not einploying men so generally in civil business, as the [lares
of Graecia did, in rcspeet of their populariry, and the state of Rome in re-
spest of the greatness of their monarchy: the present disposition of these
times at this instant to peace: the conlinnption of all that ever can be laid
in controversies of religion, which have so much diverted men from other
sciences: the perfeffion osyour majcsty's learning, which as a phoenix may
call whole vollies of wits to follow γους and the inseparable propricty of
time, which is ever more and more to disclose truth: I cannot but be
raised to this persuasi0n, that this third period of time will sar stirpass thar
of the Graeciam and Roman learning: only if men will know their own
strength, and their own weakncss both; and take one from the other, lirzht
of invention, and not fite of contraditum, and esteem of the inquisition
of truth, as ofan enterprize, and not as of a quality orornament, and em—
ploy wit and magnificence to things of worth and excellcncy, and not to
things vulgar, and of popular estimation. As for my laborm, if any man

³ , shall please himself, or others in the reprehension of them, they lhall make

that ancient and patient requcst, Verbera [ἐπ’ andi. Let men repr-cheud
them, so they observe and weigh them. For the appeal is lawful (though
it may be it shall not be needful) from the first cogitations of rnen to their
second, and from the nearer times, to the times farther off. Now ler us
come to that learning, which both the former times were not so bless'ed as
to know, sacred and inspired diviniry, the sabbath and port of all mens la-
bours and peregrinations.

THE prerogative of God extendeth as well to the reason, as to the will
of mam so that as we are to obey his law, though we find a reluelation
in our will3 so we are to believe his word, though we find a reluCtation in
our reason. For if we believe only that which is agreeable to our sense, we
give consent to the matter, and not to the author, which is no more than
we would do towards a suspee'ted and discredited witness: But that saith
which was accounted to Abraham for righteoulhess, was of such a

¹-point, as whereat Sarah laughed‚ who ther-ein was an image of natural rca-
son.

Howssmr (if we will truly consider it) more worthy it is to believe,
than to know as we now know. For in knowledge man’s mind suffereth
from sense, burin belief it fiiffcreth from spirit, such one as it holdeth for
more author-ised than it self, and so suffereth from the worthier agenn o-
therwise it is of the state of man glorificd, for then faith shall ceasc, and we
shall know as we are known. -

WHEREFORE we conclude, that sacred theology (which in our idiom
We call divinity) is grounded only upon the word and oracle of God, and
not upon the light of nature: for it is written, Coeli enarrant gloriam ‘Dei .-
but it is not written, Coeli enarrant voluntatem ‘Deis but of that it is said,
Ad legem ὅγ’ testimonium st non fecerint stcztndum verbum istud, &a This
holdeth not only in those points of faith which concern the great mysteries
of the Deity‚ of the creation, of the redemption, but likewise those which
concern the law moral truly interpreted3 Loveyour enemies, do good to them
that hate-you: Be liketo your heavenly Father, that ficffereth ltus rain tofall
upon the Just and unjust. To this it ought to be applaudcd, Nec vox homi-
