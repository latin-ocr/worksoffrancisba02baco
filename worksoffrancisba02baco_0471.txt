be thought seeretS, raritics, and special sribtilties5 which humour ofvain
= and supercilionssarroganey, is jnstly derided in ‘Plato5 where he brings in
]·{z'ps>ias a munting sophist, disputing with Socrates a true and unfeignetl in-

Ῐ quisitor of truth‚· whc're the subject being touching beauty, Socrates, aster
2 his wandering manner of induetiong put first an example of a fair virgin, and

offended3 and find, ‘⁶ More than sor courtesy’s lake, he did think much to
’ “ dispute with any that did allcdge such base and sordid instances:” whcrc-
tinto Sfocrates answei·ed‚ “ Yon have reason, and it becomes yon well,
“ being a man so trin] in your vcstments, &cf Ancl so goeth on in an
xronyt

BUT the truth is, they be not the highest instances that give the securest
infor-marion 3 as may be well express'ed in the tale so common of the philo—
sopher, that while he gazcd upwards to the starS, fell into the water ,- for if
he had looked down he might have seen the stars in the water, bnt looking
aloft, hc could not see the water in the starS. So it c'omcth often to pass,
that mean and small things discover grear, better than great can discover the
’ small: and therefore Aristotle noteth well, “ That the nature of every
‘f thing is best seen 111, his smallest portions.” And for that cause hc en-
quireth the nature of a commonwealth, first in 3 family, and the simple con-
jugations of man and wife, parent and child, master and servant, which are
in every cottage. Evcn so likewise the nature of this great city ofthe world,
and 'the policy- thereof, must be first fought in mean concordances and small
portions.- So we see how that sceret of nature, of the turning of iron,
touched with the loadstone, towards the north, was found out in needles of
iton, not in 'bars of iron.

vBUT if my judg'rnent be of any weight, the use of history mechanical is
of all others the most radical and fundamental towards natural philosophy,
such natural philosophy as shall not vanilh in the fume of subtile, sublime, or
delestable speculation, but such as {hall be operative to the endowment and
benefit of man’s life: for it will not only minister and suggest for the present
many ingenious praefices in all trades, by a conneelion and transferring of the
observations of one art to the use of another, when the experiences of seve-
ral mysteries shall fall under the consideration of one man's mind: but fai-ther,
it will give a more true and real illumination concerning causes and 31101113,
than is hitherto attained.

, Fo R like as a man’s disposition is never well known till he be cross'cd, nor
‘Proteus ever changed lhapes, till he was straightncd and held fast5 so the pas-
sages and γει-13110113 of nature cannot appear so fully in the liberty of nature,
asin the trials and vexations of art.

F 0 R civil history it is of three kinds, not unfitly to be compared with the'
three kinds of piclures or images: for of piCtures ot imageS, we see some are
unfinilhed, some are perfect, and some are defaced. So of histories we may
find three kinds, memorials, perfect histories, and antiquities ς’ for memorials
are history unfinilhed, or the first ot rough· draughts of history, and antiquities
are history defaecd, or some remnants of history which have casually escaped
the lhipwreck of time.

M E M 0 R 1 A L s, or preparatory history, are oft'wo soris, wherc'of the one
may bc tei-med cfoinmentaries‚ and the other registers. Commentaries are
they which set down a continuance of the naked events and aetions, With-
