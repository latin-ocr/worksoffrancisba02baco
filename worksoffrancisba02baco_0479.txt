BookII. OF LEARNING.

but corruptly by Machiavel, that it belong-:th to the education and disei-
pline of princes, to know as well how to play the part ofthe lion in vio>a
lence, and the fox in guile, as ofthe man in virtue and justice.

NEVERTHELESS 111 many the like encounters, 1 do rather think that the
fable was first, and the exposition devised‚ t'han that the moral was first,
and thereupon the fable framed. For Ifind it was an ancient vanity in
(ἷίανζψρριις, that troubled himself with great conteution to fasten the ass'cr-
tions of the Stoieks upon the fiffions of the ancient poets: But yet that all
the sables and 116ῒί0115 of the poets were but pleasure and not figure, I in-
terpose no opinion.

SURELY ofthose poetswhiehare now extant, even Homerhimsclf, (not-
withstanding he was made a kind of scripture by the later schools of the
Grecians,) yet Ilhould without any difficulty pronounce, that his fables
had no such inwarduels in his own meaning3 but what they might have,
upon a more original tradition, 15 not easy to affirm, for hc was not the
inventor of many of them.

IN this third part of learning, which is poesy, Ican report no deficience.
For being as a plant that cometh of the lust of the earth, without a for-
mal seed, it hath sprung up and spread abroad more than any other kind:
But to ascribe unto it that which is due for the expressing of affcctions, pas-
fions, corruptions and customS, we are beholden to poets more than ro the
philosophets workS, and for wit and eloquenee, not much less than to ora-
tors harangues. But it is not good to stay too long in the theatre. Let us
now pass on to the judicial place or palace of the mind, which we are to
approach and view with more reverence and attention.

THE knowledge of man is as the waters, some deseending from above,
and some springing from beneatl1; the one informcd by the light of nature,
the other inspired by divine revelation.
¹ THE light ofnaturc confistcth in the notions of the mind, and the reports
of the senses÷ for as for knowledge which man receiveth by reaching, it is
cumulative and not original, as 111 a water, that besides his own spring-head,
is fed with other springs and streams. So then according to these two dif-
fering illuminations or originaIS, knowledge is first of all dividcd into divi-
nity and philosophy.

IN philosophy, the contemplations of man do either penetrate unto God,
or are circumfered to nature, or are reflcsted ot reverted upon himself. Out
of which several enquiries, there do arise three knowledges‚ divine philoso<
phy, natural philosophy, and human philosophy or humanity. For all things
are marked and stamped with this triple character of the power of God, the
difference of nature, and the use of man. But because the distributions and
partitions of knowledge are not like several lines that meet in one angle, and
so touch but 111 a point, but are like branchos of a trec, that meet in a stem,
which hath a dimenfion and quantity of entireness and continuance, before
it come to discontinuc ancl break it sels into arms and boughs; therefore it
is good, before we enter into the former distribution, to ere& and cousti-
tute one universal science, by the name of philqfhplaia prima, primitive or
summary philosophy, as the main and common way, before we come where
the ways part and divide themselvess which science, whethcrl should re-
port as deficient or no, I stand doubtful.

F oR I find a certain rhapsody of natural theology, and of divers parts of
logick3 and of that other part of natural philosophy, which concerneth the
