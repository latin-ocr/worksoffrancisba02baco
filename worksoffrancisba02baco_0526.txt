tion to society, nor duty without an inward disposition ε this pai-t may seeml
at first to pertain to science civil and politick, but not if it be well observed;
for it concerneth the regimem and government of every man over himself,
and not over others. And as in architec'ture the direction of the framing the
posts, bearns and other parts of building, is not the same with the manner
of joining them and ereOting the bullding ς and in mechanicals the direstion
how to frame an instrument or enginc, is not the same with the manner of
setting it on work and employing it ; and yet nevertheless in expressing of
the one you incidently express the aptness towards the other: so the doc-
trine of conjugation of men in society differeth ,from that of their confor-
mity thercunto.

Tflls part of duty is subdivided into two parts ,- the common duty of
every man as a man or member of a state, the other the respective or special
duty of every man in his profeffion, vocation and place: the first of these is
extant and well laboured, as hath been said ; the second likewise Imay re-
port rather dispersed than deficient ,- which manner of disper-scd writing
in this kind of argument Ι acknowlcdge to be best: for who can take upon

him to write of the proper duty, virtue, challenge and right of every several

,vocati0n, profession and place? For although sometimes a looker on may

see more than a gamcster‚ and there be a proverb more arrogant than found,
“ That the vale best discovereth the hills ;’' yet there is small doubt but that
men can write best and most really and materially in their own profeffions,
and that the writing of speculative men of afflve matter, for the most part
doth seem to men of experiencc as Phormio’s argument of the wars seemed
to Hannibal, to bc but dreams and dotagc. Only there is one vice which
accompanicth them that write in their own profeffions‚ that they magnify
them in excesss but generally it were to be wished (as that which would
make learning indeed solid and fruitful) the aetive men would or could be-
come writers,

IN which kind Ι cannot but mention Honoris cansc‘z, your majesty's excel-
lent book touching the duty of a king, a work richly compounded of divi-
nity, morality and policy, with great asperfi'on of all other arts ‚- and being
in mine opinion one of the most found and healthful writings that Ι have
read, not distempered in the heat of invention, nor in the coldness of neg-
ligence3 not fick of bufiness as those are who lose themselves in their order,
nor of convulfions as those which cramp in matters impertinent3 not sa-
vouring of pei-fumes and paintings as those do who scel< to please the reader
more than nature beareth, and chiefly well disposed in the spirits thereof,
being agreeable to truth and apt for affion, and far removed from that na-
tural infirmity whereunto 1 noted those that write in their own profcssions
to be subject, which is, that they exalt it above measure ε for your majesty
hath truly described, not a king of Afflria, or Persia, in their extern glory,
but a Most-‘³ or a David, pastors of their people. Ncither can I ever
lose out of my remembrance, what Ι heard your majesty in the same sacred
spirit of government deliver in a great cause of judicature, whi'ch was,
“ That kings ruled by their laws as God did by the laws of nature, and
“ ought as rarcly to put in use their supreme prerogative, as God doth his
“ power of working miracles.” And yet notwithstanding, in your book of
a free monarchy, you do well give men to understand, that you know the
plenitude of the power and right of a king, as well as the circle of his office
and duty. Thus have Ι presumed to allcge this excellent writing of
your majesty, as a prime or excellent example of Tranates concerning spe-
