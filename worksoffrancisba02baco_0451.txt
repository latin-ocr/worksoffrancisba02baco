ploy pei-som altogether unlearned, otherwise than by inlpi1·.1ti011,1nore cvi<
dt-ntly to dcclare his immediate working, and to abase all human wisdom
or knowledge 3 yet neverthcless that connsel os his was no sooner perform-
ed, burin the next viciffitude and fflccession, he did send his divine truth
into the world, waited on with other learnings, as with servants or hand-
maids : For so we see St. Paul, who was only learned amongst the Apostles,
had his pen most used in the scriptur-cs of the New Testament.

So again, we find that many of the ancient bilhops and fathers of the
Church were excellently read, and studied in all the learning ot' the heathen 5
insomuch, that the edi& of the emperor Julianus (whereby it was inter—
dieted unto Christians to be admitted into schools, lectures² or exercises of
learning) was esteemed and accounted a more pernicioris engine and machi-
nation against the Christian saith, than were all the sanguinary prosecutions
of his predecessbrs3 neither could the emulation and jcalousy of Gregory
the first of that name, bishop of Rome, ever obtain the opinion of piety or
devotion ς but contrarywise received the censure of humour, malignity, and
pusillanimity, even amongst holy men; in that he defigncth to obliterate and

’ extinguish the memor-y of heathen antiquity and authors, But contrary-

wise it was the Christian Chnrch, which amidst the inundations of the Scy-
thiam, on the one side from the northwest3 and the Saracens from the cast,
did preserve in the sacred lap and bosom thereos, the precions relicks even
of heathen learning, which otherwise had been extinguilh'd, as if no snch

, thing had ever been,

Am) we see before our eyes, that in the age of our selves and ont fathers,
when it pleased God to call the church of Rome to account for their dege·
nerate manners and ceremonics‚ and sundry doeh-ines obnoxions‚ and fra-
med to uphold the same abuse53 at one and the same, it was ordained by the
divine providence‚ that there {honld attend withal a renovation, and new
spring of all other knowledges: and on the other fide we see the jesum,
who partly in themselves, and partly by the emulation and provocation of
their example, have much quicken'd and strengthen'd the state of learning :
we see, 1 say, what notablc service and reparation they have done to the
Roman see.

W H E R Ε F o R E to conclude this part, let it be observcd, that there be two
principal duties and services besides ornament and illustration, which philo-
sophy and human learning do perform to faith and religion. The one, be-
cause they are an effectual inducement to the exaltation of the glory of
God. For as the psalms, and other scriptur-es do often invite us to confidet,
and magnify the great and wonderful works of God, so if we should
rest only in the contemplation of the exterior of them, as they first offer
themselves to our senses, we lhould do a like injury* unto the majesty of
God, as if we should judge or construe of the storc of some excellent jewel-
let, by that only which is set out toward the street in his shop. The other,
because they minister a fingle help and preservative against unbelief and
errori for our Saviour saith, You err, not knowing the firiptures‚ nor the
power af God ,- laying before ns two books or volumes to study, if we will
be secured from error. 'First the scriptures, revcaling the will of God 5 and-
then the creatures‚ exprefl'mg his power, whereof the latter is a key unto
the former3 not only opening our understanding to conceive the true sense of
the scriptures, by the general notions of 'reason and rules of speech; but
chiefly opening our belief, in drawing us into a due meditation of the om-

nipotcncy of God, which is chiefly figned and engraven upon his wssllloe.
