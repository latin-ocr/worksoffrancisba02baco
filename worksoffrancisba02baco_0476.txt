111 16Γρ661 of many memor-able voyages after 1116 manner of heaven, about
the globe of the carth.

AND this proficience in navigation and discoveries, may plant also an
cxpectation of the farther proficience and auginentation of all scienees 3 be-
cause it may seem they ate ordained by God to be coevals, that is, to meet in
one age. ⁷

Fon so the prophet Daniel, speaking of the later times, foretelleth ‚·
Plurimi pertranfibunt (ᾤ’ multlplex erit scientia, as if the openness and
thorou‹.⁷,h paffage of the world, and the increase of knowledge were ap=
pointed to be in the same ageS, as wc sec it is already performed in great part ,-
the learning of these later times not much giving place to the former two
periods 01· returns of learning, the one 'of ‘the Graeculus, the other of
the Romans.

HISTORY ecclefiasticu, receiveth the same divifions with history civi13
but farther in the propriety thereof may be divided into the history of the
church, by a general name3 history of prophecy, and history of providence.
The first describeth the times of the militant church, whether it be fluetu-
ant, as the ark of Noah ‚· or moveable, as the ark in the wildernel's3 or at
rest, as the ark in the temple5 that is, the state of the church in persecu-
tion, in remove, and in peace. This part 1 ought in no sort to note as
deficient, only I would the virtue and sincerity of it were according to the
mass and quantity. But I ani not now in hand with 6611111163, but with
omiffions.

THE second which is history of prophc‘cy‚ consisteth of two relatives,
the prophecy, and the aCCO1nplilhment5 and therefore the nature of such a
work ought to bc, that every prophecy of the scripture be soi-ted, with the
event fulfilling the same, throughout the ages of the world, both for the
,better confirmation of saith, and for the better illumination of the chureii,-
touching those parts of prophecies which are yet unfulfilled: allowing ne-
vei-thelcss that latitudo which is agreeable and familiar unto divine prophe->
cies, being of the nature of the author with whom a thousand years are but
as one day, and therefore are not fulfilled puli&ually at once, but have spring-
ing and germinant accomplishment throughout many ages3 though the height
or fulness of them may refer to some one age.

Histoi-iaprc- ΤΗ Is is a work whichI find deficient, but is to be done with wisdom,

phctica.

sobriety and reverence, or not at all.

TH E third, which is history of providence, containeth that excellent cor-
respondence which is between God’s revealcd will, and his secret will : which·
though it be so obscure, as for the most part it is not legible to the natural
mans no, nor many times to those that behold it from the tabernacle: yet
at some times it pleascd God, for our better cstablilhmcnt, and the confilting
of those which are as without God in the world, to write it in such text and
capital letters, that as the prophet saith, He that runneth by, may read it ,-
that is, mere sensual persona, which hasten by God's judgments, and never·
bend or fix their cogitations upon them, are nevcrthelcss in their pass'age ancl
racc urged to discern it.

SUCH are the notable events and examples of God's judgmcnts, cha--
stisements, deliverances and bleffings : and this is a work which hath ·

passed {hrough the labours os many, and. therefore 1 cannot present as
omittet.
