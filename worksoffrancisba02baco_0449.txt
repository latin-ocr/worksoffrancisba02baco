BookI. 'OF' LEARNING.

power and ministry3 so as the angels of knowledge and illumination, are
placed before the angels of office and domination.

To descend from spirits and intellectual forms, to senfible and material
forms, we read the first form that was created, was light, which hath a rela-
tion and correspondcnee in nature and corporal thingS, to knowledge in
spirits and incorporal things.

S o in the distribution of days '3 we see the day wherein God did rest, and
contemplate his own works, was bleffed above all the days, wherein hc did
effe& and accomplilh thern.

A F TER the creation was finilhcd, it is set down unto us, that man was
placed in the garden to work therein, which work so appointed to him, could
be no other than work of contemplati0n3 that is, when the end of the work
is but for exercise and experiment, not for nccessity3 for there being then
no reluctation of the creature, nor swcat of the brow, man's employ-
ment must of consequence have been matter of delight in the expe-
timent, and not matter of labour for the use. Again, the first acts which
‚ man performed in paradise, consisted of the two summary parts of know-
ledge ‚- the view of creatures, and the impositlon of names. As for the
knowledge which induced the fall, it was, as was touched before, not the
natural knowledge of creatures, but the moral knowledge of good and evil 3
wherein the supposition was, that God's commandments or prohibitions
were not the originals of good and evil, but that they had other beginnings
which man aspircd to know, to the end, to make a total defection from God,

, and to dcpend wholly upon himself.

To pass on, in the first event or occurrence after the fall of man, wc see,
as the scriptures have infinite mysteries, not violating at all the truth of the
story or letter, an image of the two estateS, the contemplative state, and the
aCtive state, figured in the two persons of Abel and Cain, and in the two
fimplest and most primitive trades of life, that of the ssiepherd (who' by 'rea-
son of his leisure, rest in a place, and living in view of heaven, is a lively
image of a contemplative life ,·) and that of the husbandman3 where we
see again, the favour and election of God went to the ffiepherd, a'nd not to
the tiller of the ground.

So in the age before the flood, the holy records within those few
memorials, which are there enter'd and registet’d, have vouchsafed to men-
tion, and honour the name of the inventors and authors of mufick, and
works in metal. In the age after the flood, the first great judgment of God
upon the ambition of man, was the confufion of tongues3 whereby the
open trade and intercourse of learning and knowledge, was chiefly im*
barred.

To descend to lislosbs the lawgiver, and God's first pen: he is adorned by
the scriptures with this addition and commendation‚ “ That he was seen in
“ all the learning of the AEgyptians3 '’ which nation we know was one of
the most ancient schools of the⁷worldz for so Plato brings in the AEgyptian
priest, saying unto Solam “ Yon Grecians are ever children, you have no
“ knowledge of antiquity, nor antiquity of knowledge.'' Take a view of
the ceremonial law of A10st253 you shall find, belides the prefiguration of
Chrfi, the badge or difference of the people of God, the exerciie and im-
pression of obedience‚ and other divine uses and fruits thereofi that some
of the most learned Rabbz'ns have travelled profitably, and profoundly to ob—
serve, some of them a natural, some of them a moral sense, or redtifflon
of many of the ceremonics and ordinances. As in the law of the leptosy,
