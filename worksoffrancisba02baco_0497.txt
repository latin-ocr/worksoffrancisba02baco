worms, and the 1i1<c; they ought to have been exactly observed by multi-
tude of anatomies, and the contribution of mens several expet-rences, and
carcfully set down both historically, according to the appeai·ance3‚ and ar-
tifici-any, with a reference to the discascs and symptoms which resulted
from them, in case where the anatomy is of a defunc't patient3 whereas
now upon opening of bodies, they are passed over ssightly and in fi-
lcnce.

IN the inquiry of diseases they do abandon the cures of many, some asrnquifitto ui-
in their nature incurable, and others as pass'ed the period of cure5 so that tems, ⁸³⁶.
Sylla and the triumvirs never proscribed so many men to die, as they do by gffl'ssugfffa‘
their ignorant edidis, whcrcof numbers do escape with less difficulty, than
they did in the Roman proscriptions. Thereforc Ι will not doubt to note
as a deficiencc, that they inquire not the perfect cures of many diseaseS,
or extremities of diseases, but prononncing them incurabic, do ena& a law
of neglest, and exempt ignorance from discredit.

tion may conduce to recovery, but when it may serve to make a fair and
⁷ easy passage: for it is no linall felicity which Augustus Caefizr was wont to
wilh to himself, that same Euthanasta, and which was specially noted in the
death of Antoninus Pius, whose death was after the falhion and resemblance
of a kindly and pleasant sscep. So it is written of Epicurus, that after his
disease was judged desperate, he drowned his stomach and senscs with a
large draught and ingurgitation of wine3 whereupon the epigram was
made, Hjncstygias ebrius hazfit aquas: he was not sober enough to taste
any bitterness of the Stygian water. But the physicians contrariwise‚ do
make a kind of scruplc and religion to stay with the patient after the dis-
case is dcplored3 whereas, in my judgment‚ they ought both to inquire
the skill, and to give the attendances ,for the facilitating and ass'waging of
t'ne pains and agonies of death.

ΙΝ the consideration of the cures of diseases, I find adcficience in the Medicinae
receiprs of propriety, respeffing the particular cures of diseascs: for thessgssesfmen‘
phyficians have frustrated the fruit of tradition and expericnce by their ma-
gistralities² in adding and taking out and changing ζ md pro que, in the re-
ccipts at their pleasures, commanding sopver the medicine, as the medi-
cine cannot command over the discaseg for except it be treacle and Mithri-
datum, and of late diafiordl'um, and a few more, they tic themselves tono
receipts severely and religioussy: For as to the confections of sale which
are in the shops, they arc for readiness, and not for, propriety3 for they are
upon general intentions of purging, opening, comfordng, altering, and not
much appropriated to particular diseases5 and this is the cause why empi-
ricks and old women are more happy many times in their cures than learn-
ed phyficianS, because they are more religious in holding their medicincs.
Therefore here is the deficience which 1 find, that· physicians have not
partly out of their own pra-stice, partly out of the constant probations re-
ported in books, and partly out of the traditions of empiricks, set down and
delivered over certain experimental medicincs, for the cure of particular
diseases, belides their own conjecstural and magistral descriptions. For as
they were the tuen of the best composition in the state of Rome, which ei-
tner being romulis inclined to the people, or being tribunes inclined to the
senate3 so m vhe matter we now handle, they be the best physicians, which
