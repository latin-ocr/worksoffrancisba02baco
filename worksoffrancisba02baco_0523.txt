the spirit, and the constancy or wavcring of belief, all which are manifest to
tend to private repose and contentmcnt, and not to point of society.

lr censurcth also the philosophy of Epic‘letus, which presupposcth that
felicity must be placed in those things which are in our power, lest we be
liable to fortune and disturbance3 as ifit were not a thing much more lmppv
to fail in good and virtuous ends for the prrblick, than to obtain all that we
can wilh to our selvcs in our. proper fortune ,- as Confizlvo said to his sol—
diers, ssicwing them Naples‚ and protesting “ He had rather die one foot
‘f forwards, than to have his life securcd for long, by one foot of retreat.''
XVhereunto the wisdom of that heavenly leader harh figned, who harh affirm-
ed, “ That a good conscience is a continual feast;'' lhcwing plainly, that
the conscience of good intentions‚ howsoever liicccedirig, is amore continual
joy to nature, than all the provifion which can be made for security and
repose.

11· censui-eth likewise that abusc of philosophy, which grew general about
the time of Epift'etus, in converting it into an occupatiori or profession3
as if the purpose had been not to relist and extinguilh perturbations, but to
fly and avoid the causes of them, and to ssmpe a particular kind and course
of life to that end, introducing such an health of mind, as was that
health of body, of which Aristotle speaketh of Istrodicm, who did no-
thing all his life long but intend his health: whereas if men refer themselves
to duties of society ‚- as that health of body is best, which is ablest to endure
all alterations and extremities: so likewise that health of mind is most pro-

per, which can go through the greatest temptations and perturbations. So ass

Diogenes's opinion is to be accepted, who commended not them which ab·
stained, but them which sustained, and could refrain their mind in praeci-
pitia, and could give unto the mind (as is used in horsemanlhip) the {hor-test
stop or turn. ·

LAs r ιγ,- It censureth the tenderness and want of application in some of
the most ancient and reverend philosophcrs and philosophical men, that did
retire too eaffly from civil business, for avoiding of indignities and pertur-
bation53 Whereas the resolution of men truly moral, ought to be such
as the same Consizlvo said the honour of a soldier should be, e tela crqffi'-
ore, and not so fine, as that every thing should catch 111 11 and endan-
ger 11.

T o resume private or particular good, it falleth into the division of good
astive and paffive z for this difference of good, (not unlike to that which a·
mongst the Romans was express'ed in the familiar or houlhold ter-ms of <Pro-
mus and Condus·‚) is formed also in all things, and is best disclosed in the two
several appetites in creatures ,- the one to preserve or continue themselves,
and the other to dilate or multiply themselves ‚- whereo‘f the later seemeth
to be the worthier: For in nature the heavens‚ which are the more worthy,
are the agent 5 and the earth, which is the less worthy‚ is the patient:
In the pleasures of living crearures, that of generation is greater than that

of food: In divine doctrine, Beatius est dare quam accipere: and 111 life
there is no man's spirit so sofr, but esteemeth the effeffin'g of some'what
that he harh fixed in his defire, more than sensuality : which priority of the
arrive good, is much upheld by the consideration of our estate to be mor-tal
and exposed to fortune ε for if we might have a perpetuity and certainty
in our pleasures, the state of them would advance thei-r price. But when
