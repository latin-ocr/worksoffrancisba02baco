or THE ADVANesEMEN'r 130014114

So the case was doubtful, and had opinion on both sides, Again west-e
when Μ. Brutus and Caffi'm invited to a supper, certain whose opinions theg,r
meant to feel, whether they were fit to be made their allociates, and east forth
the question touehing the killing of a tyrant being an usurpet, they were di>
vided in opinion, some holding that servitude was the extream of evils, and
others that tyranny was better than a civil war-3 and a number of the like
cases there are of comparative duty ε amongst which that of all others is
the most frequent, where the question is of a great deal os good 10 en-
sue of a small injustice, which Jason of Theffalia determined against the
truth: Aliqua funt injuste facienda, nt 'multa juste ficri poffi'nt. 131111110-
reply is good, Anthorem praesentis . jnsiitiae habes,ſj⁹onsorenz fissurae non
habes ς 111011 must pursue things which are just 111 present, and leave the future
to the divine providenee. So then we pass on from this general part touch-
ing the exemplar and description of good.

No w therefore that we have spoken of this fruit of life, it remaineth to
speak of the husbandry that belongeth thereunto, without which part the for-
mer seemeth to be no better than a fair image, or statua, which is beautiful
to contemplate, but is without life and motion: whetcunto Aristotle himself
subscribeth in these words, N eceff e cst scilicet de virtute dicere, <sy qnidfit,
ὠ· ex qnihitsgignatnr. Inutile enim fere fuerit, virtutem quidem nosse,
acquirendae antem ejus modos (ff vim ignorare: Non enini de virtute tan-
tum, qna specie stt, quaerendum est, fid e} quomodo fiii copiam faciat ς
utrumqne enim volumus, ὠ· reni ipsam noffe ὠ· ejus compotes fieri .· hoc au-
tem ex voto non ficceedet, nist sciamus (J ex quibus <VJ quomodo. In such
full words and with such iteration doth he inculeare this part: so saith Cicero
in great commendatior] of Cata the second, that he had applied himself to
philosophy3 Non ita disputandi cansa, sed ita vivendi. And although the
neglect of our times wherein few men do hold any consultations touching
the refotination of their life (as Seneca excellently saith, ‘De partibus vitae
quisque deliberat, de firmina nemo) may make this part seem superfluous:
yetI must conclude with that aphorism of Hippocrates, ,Qti gravi Π morbo
correpti dolores non sentiunt, iis mens aegrotam they need medicine not
only to assuage the disease, but to awake the sense. And if it be said, that
the cure of mens minds belongeth to sacred divinity, it is most true: but yet
moral philosophy may be preferred unto her as a wisc servant and humble
handmaid. For as the Psalm saith, That the eyes of the handmaid look per-
petually towards the mistress, and yet 110 doubt many things are left to the
discretion of the handmaid, to discern of the mistress's will ς so ought moral
philosophy to give a constant attention to the doctrines of divinity‚ and yet
so as it may yield of her self (within due limits) many found and profitable
directions.

T HI s part therefore, because of the excellency thereof, 1 cannot but find
excecding strange that it is not reduced to written inquii-y, the rather because
it consistcth of much matter, wherein both speech and aelion is often conver· ⁴
sant, and such wherein the common ,talk of men (which is rare, but yet
cometh sometimes to pass) is wiser than their books ε It is reasonable there-
fore that wepropound it in the more particularity, both for the worthiucss‚
and because we may aequit ourselves for teporting it deficient, which seemeth
almost incredible, and is otherwise conceived and presupposed by those them-
selves that have written. We will therefore enumerate some hcads or points
thereos, that it may appear the better what-it is, and whether it bc extant.
