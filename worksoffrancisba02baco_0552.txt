which give little light, because they are so high. For the lawyers, they
write according to the states where they live, what is received law, and
not what ought to be law3 for the wisdom of a law-maker is one, and of
a lawyer is another. For there are in nature certain fountains of justice,
whence all civil laws are derived but as streamss and like as waters do
take tinctures and tastes from the soils through which they run, so do civil
laws vary according to the regions and governments where they are planted,
though they proceed from the same fountains. Again, the wisdom of a
law-maker eonfisteth not only in a platform of justice, but in the applica-
tion thereof, taking into consideration, by what means laws may be made cer-
tain, and what are the causes and remedies of the doubtfulness and incer-
'tainty of law, by what means laws may be made apt and easy to be execu-
ted‚ and what are the impediments and remedics in the execution of lawsz
what influencelaws touching private right of meum and tuum have into the
publiek state, and how they may be made apt ancl agreeables how laws are
to be penned and delivered, whether in texts or in acts, brief or large, with
prcambles or without 5 how they are to be pruned and rcformcd from time
to time, and what is the best means to keep them from being too vast in
volumes, or too full of multiplicity and crosshess3 how they are to be ex-
pounded‚ when upon causes emergent, and judicially discuffed 5 and when
upon responses and conferences touching general points or questions·, how
they are to be press'ed, rigoroussy or tenderly ς how they are to be mitigated
by equity and good conscience3 and whether discretion and i'triCr law is to
be mingled in the same courts, or kept apart in several courts. Again,
how the practice, profeffion and erudition of law is to be censured and
governed, and many other points touching the administration, and (as Ι
may term it) animation of laws. Upon which 1 insist the less, because Ι

AND for your majcsty's laws of England, Ι could say much of their dig-
nity‚ and somewhat of their defest3 but they cannot but excel the civil
laws in fitness for the government 3 for the civil law WaS, Non hos quaesitum ·

Tuus have I concluded this portion of learning touehing clvil know-

with human philosophy, philosophy in genera13 and being now at some
pause, looking back into that I have pass‘ed through: This wriring seemeth
to me (st nunquam fallit imago) as far as a man can judge of his own work,
not much better than that noise or found which muficians make while
they are in tuning their instruments, which is nothing pleasant to hear, but
yet is a cause why the mufick is sweeter afterwards. So haveI been con-
tent to tune the instruments of the muses, thar they may play that have
better hands. And surely when 1 set before me the condition of these
