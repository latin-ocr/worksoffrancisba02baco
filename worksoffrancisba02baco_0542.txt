OF THE ADVANCEMENT Book 11-

saith, is Animi janua, the gate of the mind: N one more close than Tibe-
rius, and yet Tacitus saith of Gallus, Etenim vultu offenstonem c·onjec''t'ave-
rat. So again, noting the differing charaeter and manner of his continend-
ing Germanicus and Drufiis in the senate, he saith, touehing his fashion'
wherein he carried his speech of Germanicus, thus : silagis inspeciem ador-
natis verbis, quam ut penitus sentire videretum but of ‘Drufius thus, ‘Pau-
cioribus, sed intentior, ὅ) fida oratione: and in another place, speaking of
this chamuel· of speech when he did any thing that was gracious and popular,
he saith, that in other things he was velut eluctantium verborum .· but then
again, Solutius vero loquebatur quando subveniret. So that there is no such
artifices of diflimulation‚ nor no such commanded eou‘ntenance (vultus
juffus) that can sever from a feigned tale some of these sallzions, either a
more ssight and careless falhion, or more set and formal, or more tedious
and wandring, ot coming from aman more dryly and hardly.

N mrum< are deeds such asl'ured pledges as that they may be trusted without
a judicious consideration of their magnitude and nature: Fraus fibi in parvis
fidem praestruit, ut majore emolumento fallat : and the Italian thinketh
himself upon the point to be bought and sold, when he is better used than
he was wont to be without manifest cause. For small favours, they do but
lull men asseep, both as to cantion and as to industry, and are as {Demosthenes
calleth them, Alimenta socordiae. So again we sce how false the nature os
some deeds are, in that particular which Mttianus pinctised upon Antonius
Primus, upon that hollow and unfaithful reconcilement which was made
between them3 wheteupon ,Mutianus advanced many of the friends of An-
tonius: Simul amicis ejus praefelluras ἄν tribunatus largitur: wherein
under pretence to strengthen him, he did desolate him, and won from him his
dependences.

As for words (though they be like waters to phyficians‚ full of flattety
and uncertainty) yet they are not to be despised, specially with the ad-
vantage of paffion and affection. For so we see Tiberius upon a sting-
ing and incenfing speech of Agrippina, came a step forth of his diffimuIa-
tion, when he said, “ you ate hurt, because you do not reign;” of which
Tacitus saith, Audita haec, raram occulti pectoris vocem elicuere .- cor-
reptamque Graeco versit admonuit .· ideo laedi quia non regnaret. And

tfherelfxote {he poet doth elegantly call pass'lonS‚ tortures, that urge men to con-
e s t eir ecrets: ·

Vino tortus ὠ ira.

And experience ssteweth, there are few men so true to themselves and so
settled, but that sometimes upon beat, sometimes upon bmvery, sometimes
upon kindness‚ sometimes upon trouble of mind and wcakness, they open
themselves; specially if they be put to it witha counter—diffimulation, accord-
ing to the proverb of Spain, ‘Di mentira, y sacaras verdad, “ tell a lye, ancl
ff find a truth.''

As for the knowing of men, which is at second hand from reports: mens
weakness and faults are best known from their enemies, their virtues and abi-
ltties stom their friends, their customs and times from their servants, their
conceits and opinions from their familiar friends, with whom they dis course
most. General fame is light, and the opinions conceived by superiors or
cquals :tre deceitfi113 fot to such, men arc more masked, Verior fama e‘
domesticis emanat.
