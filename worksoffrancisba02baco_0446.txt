cepreth of 1110111 by a kind of relation, (as the lawyers spcak) as if we had
known them before.

ΑΝοτΗέῐι1 error that 113111 also some affinity with the former, is a con-
ceit that of formes opinions or 10015, after variety and examination‚ the best
hath still prevailed, and suppreffed the rest: so 35 if 3 111311 should 1105111
the labour of 3 new search, he were but like to 115111 upon somewhat for—
merly rejectcd5 and by 1010011011, brought into ohlivions 35 if the multi-
tude, or the wisest for the multitude's sake, were not ready to give paffage,
rather to that which is popular and superficial, 111311 10 11131 which is lub-
stantial and profound: for the truth is, that time seemcth to 110 of the
nature of a river or stream, which carricth down to us that which is light
31101 111011711 up, and finketh and drowneth that which is weighty and solid.

ANorfl ER error ofa diverse nature from all the former, is the over ear-
ly and percmptory redufflon of knowledge into arts and methods3 from
which time commonly stiences receive finali or no 31151110111311011. But as
young 111011, when they knit and 1113Ρο perfeffly, do seldom 51011710 afar-
thcr stature: so 1011011 1001 0,111111011 15111 aphorisms 3110101110113110115, 1115
in( grow th3 but when it once is comprehendcd in exa& 11101110015, 11 may
perchance be farthei polished and 11111111 31001 and accommodated for use and
prastice3 but it encreaseth no more in bulk 31101 substance.

AN oTHER error 11111011010111 succeed that 1171110111νο1311111οη11011001, 15, 11131
after the distribution of particular 3115 31101 scicnccs, 111011 have abandoned
1111110111111), or philosophia primas which cannot but cease, and stop 311
prog, 10111011 For no perfect discoveiy can be made upon 3 flat or a le·
vzel Νο111101· 15 11 possihle to discover 1110 111010 1·,0111010 31101 dceper parts of
any 10101100, if 1011 stand but upon the 10101 of the same scicnce‚ 31101 31001101
1101 103 11151101 10101100.

ANoTHER error hath proceeded from too 51031 3 10170101100, 311013 kind
of adoration of the mind and understanding of man: by means whcrcof,
men have withdrawn themselves too much from the contemplation of na-
ture, and the observations of experience, and have rumbled up and down
in their own reason and 001100115. Upon these intellestualists, which arc not-
withstanding commonly taken for the most sublime and divine philoso-
phcrs, Heraclltns 53170 3 just censure, saying: “ Men fought truth in 111011·
“ own little 117011015, 31101 1101 111 1110 51031 and common world;’' for they dis-
‹lain to spell, and so by 01051005 10 read in the volume of God's works, and
contrariwisc by continual meditation and 3511311011 of wit, do 11150 31101 35 it
were invocate their own spirits to divine² and 51170 0130105 111110 1110111, where·
by they are deservedly deluded.

ANOTHER error 11131 113111 some connexion with this later, 15, 11131 111011
have used 10 infe& their meditations‚ opinions and doeh-ines, with some
001100115 which they have most admircd, 01· some scienccs which they
have most applied, and given all things else a 1111801110 according 10 1110111,
utterly untrue and unproper. So hath ‘Plato 11110111111151001 1115 philoso-
phy with theology‚ and Aristotle with logick, and the 10001101 school of
Plato, Praclus‚ and the 1·‚est with the 111311101113110105. For 111010 117 010
the 3115 11111011 had 3 kind of primogeniture with them 1010131117. So
113170 1110 3101111111115 made 3 philoiophy out of a few experiments of 1110 fur
nacc3 and (tilbertus our countiyman 113111 1113010 3 philoiophy out 01 1110
observat 10115 of 3 10301- stone. So Cicero, when, 100111115 1110 1010131 opinions
01 1110 11311110 of the soul, he found a 111111101311, 11131 held the 10111 was but
aharmony, saith pleasantly: Hicabartefimnonrecqffit, &a But of these
