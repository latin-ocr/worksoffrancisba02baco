OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookll.

the practices o'f profesfions‚ or other actions of civil life, which when they
setium, this want is soon found by themselves, and sooner by others. Butv
this part touching the amendment of the institutions and orders of universi-v
ties, Ι will conclude with the clause of Caesar's letter to Oppius and Balbus„
Hoc quemadmodum fieri poſjft, nonnulla mihi in mentem veniunt, &e multa
reperiri poffimt .· cleiis rebus rogo vos, ut cogitationem figsbipiatis.

· ANOTHER defeci· which Ι note ascendeth a little higher than the prece·
dent: for as the proficicnce of learning confisteth much in the orders and in·
stitutions of univer-sities in the same states and kingdom3‚ so it would be yct-
more advanoed, if there were more intelligence mutual between the uni-
verfities of Europe, than now there is. We see there be many orders and
foundations‚ which though they be divided under several sovereignties and<
territories‚ yet they take themselves to have a kind of conti-ast, fraternity
ancl correspondence one with another, insomuch as they have provincials
and generals. And surely as nature createth brotherhood in families‚ and
arts mechanical contra& brotherhoods in communalties, and the anointment
of God superinduceth a brotherhood in kings and bilhops: so in like manner
there cannot but be a fraternity in learning and illumination, relating to that
paternity which is attributed to God, who is called the father ofilluminations
or lights.

Tm: last defcet which Iwill note is, that there hath not been, οι· very
rarely been, any publick defignati0n of writers or emuli-crs, concerning such
parts of knowledge as may 'appear not to have been already sufficiently la-
boured or undertaken‚ unto which point it is an inducement to enter into
a view and examination what parts of learning have been prosecuted, and
what omitted ,- for the opinion of plenty is amongst the causes of want, and
the great quantity of books maketh a shew rather of superfluity than lack,
which surchargc neverthelcss is not to be remedied by making no more
books, but by making more good books, which, as the serpent of Me es,
might devour the serpents of the cnchanters: the removing of all the
defesis formerly enumerated‚ except the last, and of the active part also
of the last, (which is the defignation of writers) are opera bastlica ,ς to-
wards which the endeavours of a private man may be but as an image in
a· cross way, that may point at the way, but cannot go it. But the indu—
cing part of the later (which is the survey of learning) may be set forward
by private travel: wherefore Ι will now attempt to make a general and faith-
ful perambulation of learning, with an enquiry what parts thereof lie fresh
and waste, and not improved and converted by the industry of man, to the
end that such a plot made and recorded to memory, may both minister
light to any publick designation, and also serve to excite voluntary endea-
vours, wherein nevertheless my purpose is at this time to note only omis-
fions and deficicncies‚ and not to make any redargution of errors, or incom—
plcte prosecutions: for it is one thing to set forth what ground lieth unma-
mll'cgl, and another thing to corre& ill husbandry in that which is ma-
nure .
⁸ IN the handling and undertaking of which work Iam not ignorant what
1t is-thaet 1 do now move and attempt, nor insenfiblc of mine own weakness
to lustain my purpose: but my hope is, that if my extreme love to learning
carry rne too far, l may obtain the excuse of affedtiom for that it is not grant-
ed to man to love and to be wisc. But Iknow well I can use no other
liberty of judgment than 1 must leave to others; and Ι, for my part, shall

be indifferently glad either to perform my sclf, or accept from anothker²
