oF THE ADVANGEMENT BookIL

using for example, that if a stone be thrown ten thousand times up, 11 will not
learn to ascend, and that by often seeing or hearing, we do not learn to see
or hear the better. For though this principle be true in things wherein
nature is peremptory, (the reason whereof we cannot now stand to discusS,)
yet it is otherwise in things whercin nature admitteth a latitudc. For he
might see that a straight glovc will come more easily on with use5 and that a
wand will by use bend otherwise than it grew3 and that by use of the voice
we speak louder and stronger ς and that by use of enduring heat or eold, we
cndure it the better, and the like: which later sort have a ncarer resemblance
unto that subject of manners he handleth, than those instances which he al-
ledgeth. But allowing his conclusion, that virtues and vices consist in habit, he
ought so much the more to have taught the manner of superinducing that ha-
bit3 for there be many precepts of the wisc ordering the exercises of the mind,
as there is of ordering the exercises of the body, whereof we will recite a-
few.

THE first shall be, that we beware wc take not at the first either too high
a strain, or too wcak: for if too high in a diffident nature you discourage‚
in a confident nature you breed an opinion of facility, and so a ssoth, and in
all natures you breed a farther expestation than can hold out, and so an in-
satisfastion in the end3 if too weak of the other side, you may not look to
perform and ovcrcome any great task.

A N 0 T HE R precept is to praffise all things chiefly at two several times,
the one when the mind is best disposed, the other when it is worst disposed 3
that by the one you may give a great step, by the other you may work out
the knots and stonds of thc mind, and make the middle times the more easy
and pleasant.

A N 0 T Η Ε R precept is that which Aristotle mentioneth by the way,which
is to bear ever towards the contrary extreme of that whereunto we are by na·
ture inclined: like unto the rowing against the stream, or making a wand
straight, by binding him contrary to his natural crookednesS.

ANo THER precept is, that the mind is brought to any thing better,
and with more sweetness and happiness, if that whereunto you pretend be
not first in the intention, but tanquam aliud agenda, because of the natural
hatred of the mind against neeeffity and consti-aiut. Many other axioms
there are touching the managing of exercise and 6111101115 which being so con-
(11161611, 610111 prove indeed another naturc3 but being governed by chance,
doth commonly prove but an ape of nature, and bringeth forth that which is
lame and counterfeit.

S o if we ffiould handle books and studies, and what influence and operation
they have upon mannerS, are there not divers precepts of great cantion and di·
rection appertaining thereunto? Did not one of the fathers in great indig-
nation, call poesy vinum daemonum, because it increaseth temptations, per-
turbations, and vain opinions ? Is not the opinion of Aristotle worthy to be
regarded, wherein he saith, “ That young men arc no fit auditors of moral
“ philosophy, because they are not settled from the boiling heat of their affec-
“ tions, nor attempered with time and experience?'' And doth it not hete-
of come, that those excellent books and discourses of the ancient writers,
(whereby they have persuaded unto virtue most effestually, by representing
her in state and majesty, and popular opinions, against virtue 111 111611 para—
fitcs coats‚ fit to be scorned and derided,) are of so little effe& towards ho-
ncsty of life, because they are not read, and revolved by men in their
mature and settled yeatS, but confined almost to boys and beginncrs? But
