to be one of the essential forms of thing-153 as that, that is causative in na-
ture of anumber of effetis, insonmch as we sce in tlte schools both of De-
mocritus and Pythagoras, that the one did ai'cribe the ligure to the first sccds
of thing3‚ and'the other did suppose numbers to be the principles and ori-
ginals of things: And it is true also, that of all other forms <as we undet-
s’tand forms) itis the most abstraCted and separable from matter, and there-
fore most proper to metaphyfick 3 which hath likewise been the cause, why
it hath been better laboured and inquired‚ than any of the other forms,
which ate more immersed into matter.

Fon it being the nature of the mind of man (to the extreme prejudice
of knowledge) to delight in the spacious liberty of generalities, as in a
champion region, and not in the inc1osurcs of particular-ity5 the mathema-
ticks of all other knowledge were the goodliest fields to satisfy that appe-
tite.

Bur for the placing of these sciences‚ it is not much material; only we
have endeavoured in these our partitions‚ to observe a kind of perspective,
that one part may cast light upon another.

The mathematicks are either pure or mixed. To the pure mathematicks
are those scienees belonging which handle quantity determinate, merely se-
vered from any axioms of natural philosophy; and these are two, geome-
try and arithmetiek5 the one handling quantity continued, and the other
diffevered.

M1 x'D hath for subject some axioms or parts of natural philosophy, and
confidereth quantity determined, as it is auxiliary and incident unto them.

F OR many parts of nature can neither be invented with sufficient subtil—
ty, nordemonstrated with sufficient perspicuity, not accommodated unto
use with sufficient dexterity, without the aid and intervening of the mathe-
matick53 ofwhich sort are perspective, mufick‚ astronomy‚ cosmography,
architectum, eng1nary, and divers others.

IN the mathematicks I can report no deficience‚ except it be that men do
not sufficiently understand the excellent use of the pure mathematicks, in
that they do remedy and cure many defeets in the wit and faculties intel-
lectual. For, if the wit be dull, they {harpen it; if too wandel-ing, they
fix it; if too inherent in the sense, they abstrait it. So that as tennis is a
game of no use in it sels, but of great use in respe& it maketh a quick
eye, and a body ready to put it self into all postures: so in the mathema-
ticks, that use which is collateral and intervenient, it no less worthy than
that which is principal and intended.

Am> as for the mix'd mathematicks‚ 1 may only make this predifflo‘n‚
that there cannot fail to be more kinds of them, as nature grows farthet
disclosed.

Tuus much of natural science‚ or the part of nature speculative.

Fon natural prudence, or the part operative of natural philosophy, we
will divide it into three parts, experimental, philosophical and magica13
which three parts active, have a correspondence and analogy with the three
parts speculative; natural history, phyfick, and metaphyfick: for many o·-
perations have been invented, sometime bya casual incidence and occur-
rence,¹ sometimes by a purposed experiment: and of those which have
been found by an intentional experiamur, some have been found out by va—
rying, or extending the same experiment, some by transferring and com-
pounding divers experiments the one into the Other, which kind of inven-
tion an empirick may manage. - -
