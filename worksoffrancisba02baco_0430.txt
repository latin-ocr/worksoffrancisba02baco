416 OF THE ADVANCEMENT Booki‘.

in these words, placed after that kalendar or ephemerides, which he maketh
of the> diversities of times and seasons for 3113611003 and purposes3 and
concludeth thus: God laath nznde all things beautifitl or decent in the trae
return ostheirseasons: Alsa he hntlo placed the world in man's heare, yet
cannot inanfincl ont the work which God workethfrom the beginning to the
end: declaring not obscurely, that God hath framed the mind of man as
a mirrour or glass, capable of the image of the universal world, and
joyful to receive the impression thereof, as the eye joycth to receive light'5
and not only delighted in beholding the variety of thingS‚ and vicifiitude
of times, but raised also to find out and discern the ordinances and decreee,
which throughout all those changes are infallibly observed. And although
110 010111 111111111310, 11131 1110 supreme or summary law of nature, which he
calleth, The work which Godworketh from the beginning to the end, is not
poffi'ble to be found out by man ,- yet that doth not derogate from the capa-
city of the mind, but may be referred to the impediments, as of 11101111οῑ3
of life, ill conjunffion of labours, ill tradition of knowledge over‘sfom
hand to hand, and many other 1110011110111011003, whereunto the condition
of man is subjeet. For that nothing 31001 of the world 13 denied to man’s
inquiry and invention, 110 010111 111 arsEther place rule over, when he saith}
The spirit of man is as the lamp of. God, wherewith hesearcheth the in-
wardnefi of all flecrets. If then such be the capacity and receipt of the
mind of man, it is manifest, that there is no danger at all in the propor-
tion or quantity of knowledge, how large soever3 lest it should make it
swell or out-compass it self3 no, but it is merely the quantity of knowledgeg
which be it in quantity more or lesS, if it be taken without the true cot-
refflve thereos, hath in it some nature of venom or malignity, and some
cffcecs of that venom, which is ventosity or swelling. This correffive
spice, the mixture whereof maketh knowledge so sovereign, is charity,
which the apostle immediately addeth to the former clause3 for so he
saith, knowledge bloweth np, bnt charit y baileleth up ‚- not unlike unto that ·
which he delivereth in another place: If I spake, saith he, with the
fongues of men and angels, and had not chariey, it were bnt as a tinkling
cymba& not but that it is an excellent thing to speak with the tongues of
men and angeIS, but because if it be sever'd from charity, and not 1·οῑ
feri-ed to the good of men 31101 mankind, it hath rather 3 founding and
unworthy glory, than ‚a meriting and substantial virtue. And as for that
censure of Solomon, concerning the excess of writing and reading books,
and the anxiety of spirit which redoundeth from knowledge; and that
admonition of St. Paul, That we be notsednced by vain philosophy: let
those places be rightly understood, and. they do indeed excellently set
forth the true bounds and limitations, whereby human knowledge 13 con-
fined and circumscribed3 and yet without any such contrasting or 0031613-
11011, but that it may comprehend all the universal nature of things: for
these limitations are three: the first, that we do not so place our felicity
in knowledge, as we forget our mortality. The second, that We make
application of our knowledge to give our selves repose and contentment‚
and not distaste or repining. The third, that we do not presume by tlxe
contemplation of nature, to 3113111 to the mysteries of God3 for as
touching the first of these, Solomon doth excellently expound himself in
another place of the same book, where he faitln Ι saw well that know-
ledge recedeth as far from ignorance, as ltght doth from darknefs3 and that
the wtfi man's eyes keep watch in his head, whereas the fool roundeth- about
