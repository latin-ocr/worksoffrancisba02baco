empty and barren generalitics3 being but thc very husks and ihells of ici<
ences, all the kernel being forced out and expulsed with the torture and.
press of the method: And therefore as 1 did allow well of particular

topicks for invention, so 1 do allow likewise of particular methods o't' ·

knowledge, is according unto the light and prcfuppositions of that which is
delivered 3 for that knowledge, which is new and foreign from opinions re<
ceived‚ is to be delivered in another form, than that that is agrecable and
familiar 3 aud therefore Aristode, when he thinks to tax ‘Democritus dotli in

pular opinions need only but to prove 01 dispute z but those whose conceits
are beyond popular opinions, have a double labour3 the one to make them-
selves conceived, and the other to prove and demonstrate : So that it is of
necessity with them to have recourse 10 similitudes and transsations· to ex-
press themselves. And therefore in the infancy of learning, and in rude
times, when those conceits which are now trivial were then new, the world
was full of pai-ables and similitudes3 for else would men either have passed
over without mark, or else 1616191611 for paradoxcs that which was offered,
before they had understood or judged. So in divine learning, we see
how frequent parables and tropes are: for it is a rule, “ That whatso-
“ ever scienee is not consonant to presuppofitionS, must pray in aid of
“ fimilitudeS.”

Β U 1 111110 this part of knowledge concerning method, doth fatther be·-
long, not only the atcliitee'ture of the whole frame of a work, but also the
several beams and columns thereof, not as to their stuff, but as to their
quantity and figure ι and therefore method confidereth, not only the dispo-
-fi‘tion of the argument or subject, but likewise the propofitions; not as 10
their truth or matter, but as to their limitation and manner. For here'in
Ramus merited better-a great deal 'in reviving the good rules of proposi-
tions‚ K236m πρῶτὸν xmo? παντδς, &a than he⁴ did in introducing the can-
ker of Epitomes3 and yet, (as it is the condition of human things, that ac-
cording to the ancient fablcs, “ The most precious things have the most

fall upon the other. For he had n'ee'd be well condii&ed, that should de·
