a king. , “ .

THEREFORE Ι did conclude with my self, that Ι could not make unto
your majcsty a better oblation, than of some treatise tcndlng to that end,
whercof the sum will confist of these two parts: the former concerning the
excellency of learning and knowledge, and the excellency of the merit and
true glory‚ in the augmentation and propagatiou thereos: the later, what
the particular asts and works are, which have been embraced and underta-
4ken for the advancemcnt of learning3 and again, what defens and under-
'values I find in such particular asts: To the end, that though Ι cannot poll-
'tively or affirmatively advise your majcsty, or propound unto you fram'cd
particular& yet I may excite your princcly cogitatmus, to vilit the excellent
treasure of your own mind, and thence to extra& particulars for this pur·
pose, agreeable to your magnanimity and wisdom.

>ΙΝ the entrance to thc former of these, to clear the way, and asit were
to make filence, to have the true testimonies concerning the dignity of learn-
ing to be better heard, without the interruption of tacite objections: I
think good'to deliverlt from the discredits and disgraces which it hath re-
ceived, all from ignorance5 but ignorance severally disguised, appearing
¹sometimes in the zeal and jealousy of divffles, sometimes in the severity and
arrogancy of politicians, and sometimes in the errors and imperfectioris of
,learned men themselves. ⁷ , x
⁷ J„ hear the former sort say, that knowledge is of those things which arc
to bc accepted of with great limitation and caution3 that the aspiring to
evermuch knowledge, was the original temptation and fin, whereupon en-
suedfthe fall of man3 that knowledge harh in it somewhat of the serpent:
<ancl ¹therefore where it entreth into a man, it makes him swell; Scientia
,ἑῇ-βαι .· That Salomon gives a censure, That there is no end of making books,
'and that much reading is wearinefs of the flesh: And again in another place,
.T hat in spacious knowledge there is much contristation, and that he that
-encreaseth knowledge encreaseth anxiety: That S. Paul gives a caveat, Thac
wahe not spoiled through vain philosophy3 that experience demonstrates how
learned rnen have been arch-heretickss how learned times have been inclined
{to athelmi, and how the contemplation of second causes doth derogate from
sour dependcnce upon God, who is the first cause. ·

To discover-then the ignorance and error of this opinion, and the mis-
understanding in the grounds thereof, it may well appear these men do
not observe or eonfidcr, that it was not the pure knowledge of nature and
universality‚ a knowledge by the light whereof man did give names uuto
other creatures in paradise, as they were brought before him, according
unto their proprietieS, which , gave the occafion to the fall; but it was the
proud knowledge of good and evil, with an intent in man to give law
unto himself, and to depend no more upon Godfs commandments, which
was> the form of the temptation. N either is it any quantity of. knowledge,
how great soever, that can make the mind of man to ἕψε-,113 for nothing
can fill, much less extend the soul of man, but God, and the contemplation
of-God3 and therefore Solomon speaking of the two principal· senses of in-
quifition, the eye and the eat, affirmeth that the eye is never satisfied
with seeing, nor the ear with hearing5 and if there be no fulness‘, then is
the continent greater, thantheeontent: so of· knowledge ir sel-f, and the
mind of man, whereto the senses are but reporterS, he defincth likewise
