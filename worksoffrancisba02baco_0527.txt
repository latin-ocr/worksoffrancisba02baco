seemeth to me to be one of the best fortifications for honesty and virtue
that can be planted. For, as the fable goeth of the basilisk‚ that if he see
you first you clie for it, but if you see him first he dieth : so is it with de-
ceits and evil 3115, which, if they be first espied, lose their life3 but if they pre-
vent, they indanger. So that we are much beholden to Malaia-vel, ancl o-
thers, that write what men do, ancl not what they ought to do ε for it is not
possible to join serpentine wisdom with the columbine innocency, except
men know cxaffly 311 the conditions of the serpent ; his baseness and going
upon his belly, his volubility and lubricity, his cnvy and sting, and the rest,
{hat is, all forms and natures of evil: for without this, virtue lieth open and

-ν uufenced. N ay, an honest man can do no good upon those that are wicked

to reclaim them, without the help of the knowledge of evil: for men of cor-
rupted minds presuppose that honcsty groweth out of fimplicity of manners,
and believing of 9163611615, schoolmasters, and 1116115 exterior language. So
as except you can make them perceive that you know the utmost reaches of
their own corrupt opinions, they dcspise all morality ς Non recipit stultus

’ U N To this part touching respective duty, doth also appertain the duties
between husband and wife, parent and child, master and servant: so likewise
the laws of friendlhip and gratitude, the civil bond of companies‚ colleges‚
and politick bodies, of neighbourhood, and all other proportionate duties ,ς
11οῑ as they are parts of government and society, but as to the. framia'ig of
the mind of particular persons. , ¹

*THE knowledge concerning good respesting society doth handle it also,
not simply alone, but comparatively, whereunto belongeth' the weighing of
duties between person and person, case and case, particular and publick: as
we see in the proceeding of Lucius Brutus against his own sonS, which W‘aS
