dy, than it offereth cause of indispofition or infirmity: for if by a secret o-
peration, it make men perplexed and irresolute, on the other side by plain
precept, it tcacheth them when, and upon what ground to resolve3 yea,
and how to carry things in suspence without prejudice, till they resolve: if it
make rnen positive and regular, it teacheth them what things are in their
nature demonstrative, and what are conjestural3 and 35 well the use of di-
ssinffions and exceptions, as the latitude ofprinciples and rules. If it mis-
lcad by disproportion‚ or diffimilitude of examples, it reacheth men the
force of circumstances, the errors of comparssbns, and all the cautions of
application; so thatin all these it doth reclify more effectually than it 6311
pervert. And these medicines it conveyeth into mens minds much more
forcibly‚ by the quickness and penetration of examples. For let a man
look into the errors of Clement the seventh, so lively described by Guicciar-
dine, who served under him, or into the errors of Cicero painted out by his
own pencil in his epistles to Atticus, and he will fly apace from being irre-
solute. Let him look into the errors of Phocion, and he will beware how
he be obstinate or inflexible. Let him but read the fable of Ixion, and it
will hold him from being vaporous 01· imaginative. Lct him look into the
errors of Cato the second, ancl 116 will never 06 0116 of the Antipodes, to
tread opposite to the present world. ·

ΛΝΒ for the conceit that learning should disposc 111611 10 leisure and pri-
vateness‚ and make men ssothfuls it were a strange thing if that which ac-
custometh the mind to a perpetual motion and agitation should induce
ssotlifulnes5‚ whereas contrariwise ‘it may be truly affirmed, that no kind of
men love business for it sels, but those that are learned: for other persons
love it for profit3 as an hireling that loves the work for the wage83 or for
honour3 as because it beareth them up in the eyes of men, and refrelheth
their reputations, which otherwise would wear3 or because it putteth them
in mind of their fortune, and giveth them occasion to pleasure and. displea-
sure; or because it exerciseth some faculty, wherein they take pride, and so
entertaineth them in good humour 31161 pleafing conceits toward them-
selve53 or because it advanceth any other their ends. So that 35 11 15 said of
untrue valours, that some mens valours are in the eyes of them that look
on3 so such mens industries are 111 1116 eyes of others, or at least in regard
of their own designments‚ only learned men love busmess‚ as 311 astion.
according to nature, as agreeable to health of mind, as exercise is to health
of body, taking pleasure in the 3611011 11 seIf, and not in the purchase: so
that of all rnen they are the most indefatigable‚ if it be towards any buss-
ness which can hold or detain their mind,

ΛΝΒ ifany man be laborious in reading and study, and yet idle in bufi-
11615 31111 aetion, it groweth from some weakness of body, or softness of spi-
rit; fiich as Seneca speaketh of: Qidam tam simt umbratiles, ut putent in
turbido effe, quicquid in luce est3 and not of learning: well may it 06, that
such a point of 3 man’s nature may make him give himself to learning, but
it is not learning that breedeth any such point in his nature.

AND that learning should take up too much time or leisure: Ι 3111·11]61·,“
the most active or busy man that hath been or can be, harh (no question)
many vacant times of leisure‚ while he expesteth the tides and returns of
business (except he 06 either tedious and of no dispatch‚ or lightly and un-
worthily 311101110115, 10 meddle in things that may 06 better done by others :)
and then the question 15, but how those spaces and times of leisure shall be
filled and spent3 whether in pleasures, or in studies; 35 was well answered
