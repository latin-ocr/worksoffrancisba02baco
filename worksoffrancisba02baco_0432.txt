OF THE ADVANCEMENT EookL

AND as sor 1110 disgraees which learning reeeiveth from poliiieians, they
be of 11115 1131111ος 11131 learning doth sosten mens minds, and makes them
more unapt for the honour and exereise of arms3 thar it dotlt 11131· and pes-
vert mens dispositions for matter of government and policy; in making them
too curious and irresolute by variety of readings or 100 peremptory or positive
by striemcss os rules and axioms3 or too immoderate and overwcening by
reason osthe greatness of example& or 100 incompatible and differing from
the times, by* reason of the dissimilitude of examples3 or 31 least, that it
doth divert mens travels from astion and business, and bringeth them to 3
love of leisure and privateness3 and that it doth bring into states 3 relaxation of
discipline, whilst every 11131115 111010 ready to argue, 111311 10 obey and exe-
eute. Ο111 of this conccit, Cato, sirnamed the Censor, 0110 of the wiscst
men indeed that ever lived, when Carneades the philosopher carne in em-
bassage to Rome, and that the young 111011 of Rome began to 110οκ about‘him,
being allured with the swoetness and majesty of his eloquenee and learning,
gave counsel in open lenate, that they should give him his dispateh with all s
speed, lest he 111011101 infe& and 0110113111 the minds and affeetions ofsthe ⁴
youth, and at unawares bring in an alteration of the manners and customs
of the state. Out of the same 00110011 01· humour did Virgjl, turning his
pen to the advantage of his countrey, and the dis-advantage of his own pro-
seffion, make a kind of separation between poliey and government, and be-
tween arts and sciences, in the verses so much renowned, attriburing and
challenging the one to the Romans, and leaving and yielding the other to
the Grecians, Tu regere imperio populos, Romane memento, Hae tibi erunt ar-
tes, &a So likewise we see that Anytus the accuser of Socrates laid it as air
article of charge and accusation against him, that he did with the variety
and power of his discourses and disputations, withdraw young 111011 from
due reverence to the laws and customs of their countrey: and that hc did
profess a dangerous and pernicious science, which was to make the worse
matter seem the better, and to suppress truth by force of eloquence and
speech.

Bur these and the like imputations have 13111013 countenancc of gravi-
ty‚ than any ground of justice: for experiencc doth war-rant, that both in
persons and in times, there 113111 been a meeting, and concurrenee in learn-
ing and 311115, flouriffiing and excelling in the same men, and the same
ages For as for men, there cannot be a better nor the like instance, as of
that pair Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar the 1316131015 whereof
the one was Aristotle's scholar in philosophy, and the other was Cicero's ri-
val in eloquenee3 or if any man had rather 0311 for scholars that were great
generals, than generals that were great seholars, let him take Epaminondas
the Thebon, or Xenophon the Athenian ς ‘Whereof the 0110 was the first that
abated the power of Sparta, and the other was the first that made way to
the overthrow of the monarchy of Persia. And this concurrence is yet more
visible in times than in persons, by how much an age is greater object than
a man. For bothin AEgypt‚ Astyria, Persia, Graecia and Rome, the same
times that are most renowned for arms, are likewise most admircd for learn-
ing3 so that the greatest authors and philosophers, and the greatest captains
and governours have lived in the same ages. N either canit otherwise be: for
as in man, the ripencss of the strength of body and mind cometh much about
an age, save that the strength of the body cometh somewhat the more early:
so in states, arms and learning, whereof the one correspondeth to the body²
the other to the soul of man, have a concurrence or near sequence in times.
