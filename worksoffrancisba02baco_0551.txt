“ that if she be too much wooed she is the fai-ther off? But this last is
but a remcdy for those whose tastes arc corrupted 5 let men rather build up-
on that foundation which is as a corner-stone of divinity and philosophy,
wherein they join close, namely‚ that sanie primum quaerite. For divinity
{aith primum quaerite regnum Dei, ᾤ’ ista omnia adjicientur vobis .· and phi—
losophy saith, primum quaerite bona animi, caetera ant aderunt, autnon
oberunt. And although the human foundation harh somewhat of the sands,
as we see in M. Brutus when he brake forth into that speech 5

Te colui (virtus) ut rem: ast tu nomen inane es .-

 

‘Yet the divine foundation is upon the rock. But this may serve for a taste
of that knowledge which I noted as deficient.

’ C oN CF, R N 1 N G governmcnt, it is a part of knowledge, secret and retired
in both these respects, in which things are decincd secrct; for some things
are secret because they are hard to know, and some because they are not fit
to utter3 wc sce all governments are obscure and invisible.

“Totamque infusit per artas,
AlIens agitat molem, ἄν magno se corpore unsset.

Such is the description of gox‘ernments: we sec the government of God
ovet the World is hidden, insomuch as it seemeth to participate of much
irregularity and confusion: the government of the soul in moving the body
is inward and profound, and the paffages thereos hardly to be reduced to de·
monstratIOn. Again‚ the wisdom of antiquity (the {hadows whereof are
in the poets) in the description of tot-ments and pains, next unto the crime
of rebellion which was the giants offencc‚ doth detest the offence of futili-
ιγ, as in Sisyphus and Tantalus. But this was meant of particulars; never-
theless even unto the general rules and discoutses of poliey and government,
there is due a reverent and reserved handling.

B U 1· contrariwise in the governorstowards the governed, all things ought
as far as the frailty of man permitteth, to be manifest and revcalcd. For
so it is express'ed in the Scriptures touching the government of God, that
this globe which seemeth to us a dark and ihady body, is in the view of
God aserystal, Et in conspeft'ufhdis tanquam 'mare vitreum stmile crystallo.
So unto princes and states, specially towards wisc senates and couneus, the
natures and dispositions of the people, their conditions and neceffities‚ their
factions and combinations‚ their animofities and discontents ought to be in
regard o'f the varietyof their intelligences, th'e wisdom of their observa-
t'ions, and the height of their station where they keep centinel‚ in great
part clear and transparent'3 whereforc, confidering thatI write to a king
that is a master of this seience, andis so well affistcd‚ 1 think it decent to
pass over this p'art in silence, as willing to obtain the certificate which one
of the ancient philosophers aspired unto 3 who being silent, when others con-
rended to make demonstr-atlon of their abilities by speech, defired it might
becci-tified for his part, “ that there ‘was one that knew how to h'ol'd his
peace.'' ·

’ Ν ’οτ w ITHSTA NDIN'G for the more publick part of government, which
is laws, Ithink good to note only one deficience: which is, that all thole
which have written of laws‚ ha've written either as philosophers, or as law-
yers and none as statefinen. As for the philosophers, they make imagina-
ry laws for imaginary commonwealths‚ and their discourses are as the stars,
