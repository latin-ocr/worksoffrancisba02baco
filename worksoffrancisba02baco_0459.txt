T H Ε last speech which 1 will mention, was used to Mcscllaxs ι when (jae
slir, after war declared, did poss'ess himself of the city ot' lea-me, at which
rime entring into the inncr treasury to take the money there accumulate-d,
Metellus being tribune forbad him: whcreto Caesar said, “ 'sliat ir' he did
‘¹‘ not desili, he would lay him dead in the place.'' And preienrly taking
himself up, he added, “ Young man, it is harder for me ro speak it, than to
“ do it:” Adoleficns, durius ellmihz' hoc dicere qnam siccae. A speech
compounded of the greatest terror and greatest clemency that could proceed
bur of the mouth of man.

B UT to return and conclude with him : it is evidenr, himself knew well
his own pcrfeffion in learning, and took it upon him, as appeared, when up-
on occasion that some spake, what a strange resolution it was in Lucius Sylla,
to refign his diCtaturc3 he scoffing at him, to his own advantage, answered,
“ That Sylla could not skill of letters, and therefore knew not how to
“ dietate?

AN D here it were fit to leave this point, touching the concurr-enee of
military virtue and learning, (for what example lhould come with any grace,
after those two of Alexander and Caesar ,9 ) were it not in regard of the
rareness of circumstance, that I find in one other particular, as that which did
so suddenly pass from extreme scorn to extreme wonder ε and it is of Xeno-
phon the philosopher, who went from Socrates's school into Asta, in the
‚expedition of erns the younger, against king Artaxerxes. This Xeno-
phon at that time was very young, and never had seen the wars before3
neither had any command in the army, but only follow'd the war as avo-
luntary‚ for the love and conversation of Proxenus his friend ,⁴ he was pre·
sent when Falinus came in mefl'age from the great king to the Grecians,
after that Cyrus was ssain in the field, and they a handful of men left to
’ themselves in the midst of the king's territories, cut off from their countrey
>by many navigable rivers, and many hundred miles.- The meffage imported,
that they ihould deliver up their arms, and submit themselves to the king’s
mercy. To which meffage, before answer was made, divers of the army
conferi-ed familiarly with Falinus : and amongst the rest Xenophon hap-
pen'd to say: “ Why, Faenus, we have now but these two things left, our
“ arms and our virtue3 and if we yield up our arms, how {hall we make
“ use of our virtue ? '’ Whercto Falinus, smiling on him said, “ If 1 be not
“ dcccix-cd, young gentleman, you are an Athenian, and 1 believe you study
“ philosophy, and it is pretty that you says but you are much abused‚ if
“ you think your virtue can withstand the king’s power.” Here was the
scoria: the wonder followed3 which was that this young scholar or philo-
sopher, after all the captains were murthered in parly by treason, conducted
those ten thousand foot‚ through the heart of all the king's high countreys
from Babylon to Graecia in safety‚ in despight of all the king’s forces, to the
astonishment of the world, and the encouragement of the Grecians in
times succeeding ro make invasion upon the kings of ‘Pedias as was after
purposed by Jason the Thcffalian‚ attempted by Argefilaus the Spartan,
and atehieved by Alexander the Macedonian, all upon the ground of the
a& of that young scholar.
