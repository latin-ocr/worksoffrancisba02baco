philosophers and scicnccs of Aristone, Plato, Democritus, Hippocrates, E u-
clides, Archimedes, of most vigour at the first, and by time degenerare and
imbased5 whereof the reason is no other, but that in the former many wits
and industries have contributcdin one; aud in the latter, many wits and in-
dustries have been spent about the wit of some one, whom many times they
have rather depraved than illustrated. For as water will not ascend higher
than the level of the first spring-head, from whence it descendeth: so know-
ledgc derived from Aristotle, and exempted from liberty of examination,
will not rise again higher than the knowledge of Arzstotle. And therefore
although the position be good, Oportet dist-entem credere,- it must be cou-
pled with this, Oportet eduetum judicare: for disciples do owe unto masters
only a temporary belief, and a suspension of their own judgment, till
they be fully instrusted, and not an absolute resignation, or perpetual cap-
tivity: and therefore to conclude this point, I will say so more3 but so
let great authors have their due, as time which is the author of authors
be not deprived of his duc, which is farther and farther to discover truth.
Thus have Igone over these three diseases of learning3 befidcs the which,
there arc some other rather peccant humours than formed diseases, which
nevertheless arc not so secret and intrinlick, but that they fall under a
popular observation and traducentem, and therefore are not to bc passed
over.

THE first of these is the extreme affcffing of two extremities3 the one
antiquity, the other novelty3 wherein it scemeth the children of time do
take after the nature and maliee of the father. For as he-devoureth his
children, so one of them seeketh to devour and suppress the other, while
antiquity envieth there {hould be new additionS, and novelty cannot be con-
tent to add, but it must deface5 surely, the advice of the prophet is the
true direction in this matter, State fitper vias antiquas, dy videte quaenam
stt via recta esf bona, <VJ ambulate in ea. Antiquity deserveth that reve-
rence, that men should make a stand thereupon, and discover what is the
best Way; but when the discovery is well taken, then to make progression.
And to speak truly, Antiquitasfizefflll, juventus mundi. These times are the
antient times when the world is ancient, and not those which we account
‚ancient ordtne retrogrado, by a computation backward from our selves.

¹ ANOTHER error induced by the former, is a distrust that any thing

ssiould be now to be found out which the world should have niiss'ed and
paffed over so long time3 as if the same objection were to be made to
time, that Lucian maketh to Jupiter and other the heathen god3‚ of which
hc wondereth, that they begot so many children in old time, aud begot
none in his time; and asketh whether ‘they were become septuagenary, or
whether the law Papia made against old mens marriages had restrained
them. So it secmeth men doubt, lest time is become past children and
generatioffi wherein eontrariwise‚ we see commonly the levity and uncon-
stancy of mens judgments‚ which till a matter be done, wonder that it ean
be done; and assoon as it is done, wonder again that it was no sooner
done; as we see in the expedition of Alexander into Asta, which at first was
prejudged as a vast and impollible enterprize: and yet afterwards it plea-
seth Livy to make no more of it than this; Nil aliud quam bene atfits est
vana contemnere: A nd the same happened to Celaeneus in the western navi-
gation. But in intellectual matters, it is much more commom as may be
seen in most of the propositions of Euclid, which till they be demonstratcd>
they seem strange to our ass'ents but being demonstrated, our mind aci—
