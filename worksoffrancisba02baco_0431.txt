ssmki, or LEARNING. 417

in darkncfr: bzztzsjthall learned, that thesbme mortalitjv invola-eth them·
both. And. for the second, certain it is there is no vexation or anxiety of
mind which resulteth from knowledge, otherwise than merely by accident:
for all knowledge aud wonder (which is the sc'ed of knowledge) is an im-
prcssIGn of pleasure in it sclf: but when meu fall to framing conclusions
out of their knowledge, applying it to their particular, and ministring un—
to themselves thercby weak fears, or vast defit-es, there growcth that care-
fulness and trouble of mind which is spoken of: for then knowledge is no
more Lumen siccum, whereof Heraclitus the profound said, Lrimenstccum
optima animas but it becometh Lumen madidum, or maceratam, being
stceped and infused in the humours of the affeffions. And as for the
third point, it deserv-eth to be a little stood upon, and not to be lightly
pass'ed over: for if any man {hall think by view and ‘enquiry into these
sensible and material things, to attain that light whereby h‘e may reveal
unto himself the nature or will os God; then indeed is he spoiled by vain‘
’ ς philosophy: for the contemplation of God’s creatures and works produceth
⁴(having regard to the works and creatures themselves) knowledge, but hav-
ing I‘egard to God, no perfeft knowledge, but wonder, which is broken
knowledge. And therefore it was most aptly said by one of Plato’s school,
Ε( That the sense of man carrieth a resemblance with the sun, which (as
“ we see) opencth and rcvealeth all the terrestrial globe3 but then again
“ it obscureth and concealeth the stars and celestial globe: so doth the
‘⁶ sense discover natural things, but it darkneth and lhutteth up divine.’'
And hence it is true, that it hath proceeded, that divers great learned
{nen have been heretieal, whilst they have fought to fly up to the sectets
of the Deity, by the waxen wings of the senses: and as for the conceit'
that too much knowledge should incline a man to atheism‚ a'nd that the'
ignorance of second causes should make a more devout dependance upon
God, which is the first cause: first, it is good to ask the question which
Job asked of his friends: lVillyou ζγε for God, as one man will do for an-
other, to gratzffl him? For certain it is, that God worketh nothing in
nature but by second causes; and if they would have it otherwise believed,
it is mere imposture, as it were in favour towards God3 and nothing else
but to offer ro the author of truth, the unclean sacrifice of a lye. But:
fatther, it is an assured truth‚ and a conclusion of experience‚ that a little
or superficial knowledge of philosophy may incline the mind of man to
atheisrn, but a farther proceeding thereiu doth· bring the mind back again.
to religion; for in the entrance of philosophy, when the second causes,
which are next unto the senses, do offer themselves to the mind of man,
if it dwell and stay there, it may induce some oblivion of the highest eause;¹
but when a man pass'eth on farther‚ and seeth the dependance of causes,
and the works of providence; then, according to the allegory of the p'oets,
he will cafily believe that the highest link of nature's chain must needs be'
tyed to the foot of qupiter's chair. To conclude therefore, let no man up-
on a weak conccit of sobriety, or ·an ill apply'd moderation, think or main-
tain, that a man can search too far, or be too well studied in the book of
God's word, or in the book of God's works3 divinity or philosophy3 but'
rather let men endeavour an endless progress, or proficience in both; only
let men beware that they apply both to charity, and not to swelling3 to
use, and not to ostentatiom and again, that they do not unwisely mingle,
or eonfound these learnings together.
