sciences for excellency or speedy profiting ; and therefore it is an inqulry of
great wisdom what kinds of wits and natures are most proper sor what
sciences.

F o un τ Η L Y, the ordering of exercises is matter of great consequence to
hurt or help: for, as is well obscrved by Cicero, men in exercifing their fa-
cultics, if they be not well advised‚ do exercisc their faults and get ill habits
as well as good3 so there is a great judgment to be had in the continuance
and intermislion of exerciscs. lt were too long to particularize a number of
'other considerations of this nature3 things but of mean appearance, but of
fingular efficacy : for as the ernging or cherishing of seeds or young plants,
is that that is most important to their thriving: and as it was noted, that
the first fix kings, being in truth as tutors of the state of Rome in the infancy
thereos, was the principal cause of the immense greatness of that state which
followed, so the culture and manurance of minds in youth bath such a for-
cible (though unseen) operation, as hardly any length of time or contentiori
of labour can countetvail it afterwardsa And it is not amiss to observe also,
how small and mean faculties gotten by education, yet when they fall into
great men or great matters do work great and important effect53 whereof
we see a notable example in Tacitus, of two stage-playerS, Percennius and
Vibulenus, who by their faculty of playing put the Pannonian armies into
an extream tumult and combustion3 forthere arifing a mutiny amongst them,
u'p'on the death of Augustus Caefitr, Blasstaes the lieutenant had committed
some of the mutineers, which were suddenly rescued 3 whereupon Vibule-
nus got to be heard speak, which he did in this manner : ‘³ These poor inno'-
“ cent wretches appointed to cruel death, you have restored to behold the
“ light: but who shall restore my brother tome, or life unto my brother,
“ that was sent hither in mess'age from the legions of Germany, to treat of
-“ the common cause? And he hath murdered him this last night by some
“ of his fencers and ruffians, that he harh about him for his executionem
“ upon soldier-s. Answer‚ Blacfits‚what is done with his body? The mor-
“ tallest enemies do not deny burial3 When I have performed my last dutie's
“ to the corps with kiss'es, with tcars, command me to be ssain besides him,
·“ so that these my fellows for our good meaning, and our true hearts to
“ the legions may have leave to bury us.'' With which speech he put the
army into an infinite fury and uproar3 whereas truth Was he had no brother,
neither was there any such matter, but he play'd it merely as if he had been
upon the stage. ,

Bu T to return, we are now come to a period ofratio'n‘al knowledges,where-
in if 1 have made the divifions other than those that are received, yet would 1
not be thought to disallow all those divifions whichI do not use3 for there
is adouble neceffity imposed upon me of altering the divifions. The one,
because it differeth in end and purpose, to sort together those things which
are next in nature, and those things which are next in use3 for if a secretary
nfestate, should sort his papers, it is like in his study, or general cabinet, he
would sort together things of a nature, as treaties, instrue‘tions2 &a but in
his boxes, or particular cabinet, he would sort together those that he were
like to use together, though of several natures; so in this general cabinet
of knowledge it was necessary for me to follow the divisions of the nature of
things, whereas if my self had been to handle any particular knowledge, I
would have respeeted the divifions fittest for use. The other, because the
bringing in of the deficiences did by consequence alter the partitions of the
:est3 for let the knowledge extant (forsplemonstration sake) be fifteen, liet
