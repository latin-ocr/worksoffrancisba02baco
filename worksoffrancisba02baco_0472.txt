occasions, and other passages of aetion : for this is the true nature of a coni-
mentary‚ <though Caesar in modesty mix'd with greatness, did fot his pleasure
apply the name of a commentary to the best history of the world 3) registers
are collections of publici< asts, as dccrccs of couness, judicial proceedings, de-
clarations and letters of state, orations, and the like, without a perse-St conti-
nuance or contexture of the thread of the narration.

A N τ 1 qu 1 T 1 E s, or remnants of history, are, as we said, tanquam tabula
naufragii, when industrious persons, by an exa& and scrupulous diligence y
and observation out of monuments, names, words,provcrbs‚ traditions, pri-
vate records and evidences, fragments of stories, palinges of books thar con-
cern not story, and the like, do save and recover somcwhat from the deiuge
of time.

IN these kind of imperfe& histories Ι do affign no deficience, for they are
tanquam imperfec‘i‘e mzsta, and therefore any deficience in them is but their
nature.

As for the corruptions and moths of history, which are epitomes, the
use of them deserveth to be banilh¹d, as all men of found judgment have
confeffed, as those that have fretted and corroded the found bodies of
many excellent histories, and wrought them into base and unprofitable
dre s.

1-{1 s τ o R Y, which may be called just and perstet history, is of three kinds,
according to the objeet which it propoundeth, or pretendeth to repre-
sent: for ir either representeth a time, or a person, or an astion. The
first we call chronicles, the second lives, and the third nan-anons, or re-
lations.

OF these, although the first be the most complete and absolute kind of
history, and hath most estimation and glory, yet the second excelleth it in.
profit and use, and the third in verity and fincerity. For history of times te-
presenteth the magnitude of actions, and the publiek faces and deportments
of persons, and paffeth over in silence the smaller passages and motions of
men and matters.

Bur such being the workmanship of God, as he doth hang the'greatest
weight upon the smallest wires, Maxima e minimis fhspendens, it comes
therefore to pass, that such histories do rather set forth the pomp of business,
than the true and inward resorts thereof. But lives, if they be well written,
propounding to themselves a person to represent, in whom actions both
greater and smaller, publick and private, have a commixture, must of necessity
contain a more true, native and lively representation. So again narrations
and relations of actions, as the war of Peloponncfits, the expedition of Cyrus
Minor, the conspiracy of Cutiliae, cannot but be more purely and. exaffly
true, than histories of times, because they may chuse an argument compre-
henfible within the notice and instruCtions of the writer: whereas he that
undertaketh the story of a time, especially of any length, cannot but meet
with many blanks and spaces which he must be forced to fill up, out of his
own wit and conjecture. -

Fon the history of times, (1 mean of civil history) the providenee of
God hath made the distribution : for it hath pleased God to ordain and il-
lustrate two exemplar states of the world for armS, learning, moral virtue,
policy and laws. The state of Graecia, and the state of Rome; the histories
whereof occupying the middle part of time, have more ancient to them,

histories which may by one common name be tetmed the antiquities of ἷξε
