yet after a period of time, when the mist began to clear up, they grew 1ο
130 esteemed but as old wives fables, impostures of 1110 clergy, illufions of

So in natural history, we 100 there 113111 not been 11111 0110100 and judg

ment uled as ought 1011310 been, as 11131 appear in th: 111-11111ξἣ 15 ofPlz‘niuc,
Cardmtus, Alberlffns and divers of the Arabiam, being stau( 111 with much
fabulous matter, a great part not only untried, but notorioussy untrue, to
the great derogation of the eredit of natural philosophy, with the grave
and sober kind of wits; wherein the wisdom and integrity of Arssotle is
worthy to be observed, that having made so diligent and exquisite a history
of living creatur-es, 113111 mingled it sparingly with any vain or feigncd 11131-
101, and yet 011 1110 011101· side, 113111 0311 311 prodigious narrations, which
he thought worthy the recording, into one book: excellently discerning that
matter of manifest truth, such whereupon observation and rule was to be
built, was not to be mingled or weakned with matter of doubtful credit:
and yet again, that rarities and repom, that seem incredible, are not to be
suppresscd ot denied to the memory of men.
, AND as for the facility of credit which is yieldcd to arts and opinions, it
15 likewise of two kinds, either when too much belief is attributed to the
3115 themselves, or to certain authors in any 311. The sciences themselves
which have had better intelligence and confederacy with the imagination of
man, than with his reason, are three in number: astrology, natural ma-
gick, and alchymy3 of which sciences nevertheless, the ends or pretenees
are noble. For astrology pretendeth to discover 11131 correspondence, or
concatenation, which is between the superior globe and the inferior. Na-
tural 1113ςίοκ pretendeth to call and reduce natural philosophy from variety
of speculations to the magnitude of works3 and alchymy pretendeth to make
separation of all the unlike parts of bodies, which in mixtures of nature 310
incorporate. But the derivations and prosecutions to these ends, both in the
theories, and in the practices, are full of error and vanity, which the great
profeffors themselves have fought to veil over and conceal by enigmatical
writings, and referring themselves to auricular traditions and such other
devices, to save the credit of impostors3 and yet surely to alchymy this right
is due, that it may be compared to the husband-man whereofAEsbp makes
the fable3 11131 when 110 died, told his sons, that 110 had left unto them
gold buricd under ground in his vineyard3 and they digged over all the
ground, and gold they found nones but by reason of their stirring and dig-
ging the mould about the 10015 of their vines, they had 3 great vintage
the year following: So affurcdly the search and stir 10 1113κο gold 113111
brought to light a great number of good and fruitful 11111011110115 31101 ex-
periments, as well for the diselofing of nature, 35 sor the use of man's ’
life.

AND as for the overmuch credit that harh been given 111110 311111015111
sciences, in making them 0116131015, 11131 111011 words should stand, and not
consuls to give 3111110ος 1110 damage is infinite that sciences have received
thereby‚ 35 1110 principal cause that 113111 kept them low, at 3 stay, without
growth or advanccment. For hence it 113111 001110, 11131 111 3115 11100113111-
eal, the first deviser comes shortest, and time addeth and persecteth: but
in 101011005, 1110 first author goeth firthest, and time loseth and corrupteth.
So 1110100, 3111110111, sailing, printing , and the like, were grossly managed
31 1110 first, and by time accommodated and refincd: but contrariwisc the
