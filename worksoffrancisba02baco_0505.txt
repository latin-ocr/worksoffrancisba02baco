To procure this ready use of knowledge there are two courses, prepara-
tion 31101111550111011. The former of these seemeth scarcely a part of know-
101150, consisting rather of diligence than of any 3111110131 erudition. And
herein Argstotle wittily, but hurtfully, doth deride the sophists near 1115 time,
iaying, ‘⁶ They did as if one that profcss'cd the art of lhoemaking 1111111111
“ 1101 103011 how to make up a 11100, but only exhibit in a readiness a 1111111»
“ ber 01111005 of all faffiions and fizcs.” But yet a 111311 11115111 reply, that
if a lhoemaker 111011101 have no 111005 111 1115 111ορ but only work as he 15
bespoken, 110· should be weakly customed. Bur our Saviour, spe1l<ing ’,01
divine knowledge, 131111, “ That the 1(111( 5010111 of heaven is like 3 good
“ houlholder‚ tha’t bringcth forth both new and old store: '' and we see 1110·
ancient writers of rhetorick do give it in precept, that ple-iders {hould
113νο 1110 places whereof they have: most continual use, ready handled in all
the variety that may be; as that, to fpeak for the literal interpretation of
the law against equity and contrary, and to spcak for presumptions and in-
l'erences against testimony and contrary. And Cicero himself, being broken

unto it by great experience, delivereth it plainly3 11131 whatsocvcr 3 man.

111311113Υο occasion 10 spe 11( of, (if he will take the pains. > 110 may have it in
effe& premeditate‚ and handled in Thes: So 11131 when he cometh to a
particul 1111, 110 111311 have nothing to do but to put 10 11311105, and times, aud
places, and luch other circumstances of individuaIS. We see likewise 1110
exac't diligencc of Demosthenes, who in regard of the great force that
the entrance and 300015 11110 caules hath to make a good impreffion, had
1010111 1131110013 number of prefaccs for orations and ipceches3 all which au-
1110111105 and precedents may ovcrweigh Aristotle’ 5 opinion, thar would have
115 0113115 0 3 11011 w ardrobe for 3 pair of l'heais.

D 111· t 10 nature of the 0011001103 of this provisson ot preparatory store,
1110351111 13000111111011 both to 105101( and rhetorick, yet having made an
c rt ry ot it 11010, where it came first to be lpoken 01ἷ,1 think fit to refer
0101· the farther handling of 11 10 rhetorick.

T HE other part of invention which Iterm suggestion, doth assign and
direci us to 00113111 marks or places, which may excite our mind to re-
tur· 1 and produce such knowledge, 35 it hath formerly 0011061001, 10 the end

we may make 1110 thereos. Neither is this 1110 (truly taken) only to fur—-

nilh argument to dispute probably with others, but likewise to minister
unto our iud:¹ (11110111 10 conclude 3115111 1ν1111111 our selvcs. Neither may these
p 13005 serve only to prompt our invention, but also to 0111·οἃ 0111· inquiry
For 3 faculty 01 wile interro garing is half a knowledge. For as Plato saith,
‘⁴ W holoever scckcth, k110xver11³that which he 1001(0111 for in a general no-
¹‘ tion, else how 111311 110 know it when 110 113111 found it?'' And therefore
the larger your anticipation is, the more dire& and compendious is your
search. But the same places which will help us what to produce of that
which we know already, will also help us, ifa man of expericnce were be-
fore 115,111111 questions to ask3 or if we have books ancl authors to 1111111161
115 what points to 1031011 and revolve: so as 1 cannot repon, that this part
of invention, which is that which the schools call topicks, is deficient.
NEVERTHELESS topicks are of two forts, general and special. ’111050-
neral we have lpoken to, but the particular 113111 been touched by some,
but rejected ‹ u‚enerally as inartificial and variable. But leaving the humour
which harh reigned too much m the schools (which is to be t'vainly subtile
in a sew things, which are within their command, and to reject the rest) 1
011) receive particular topick5‚ that is, places or directions of invention and
