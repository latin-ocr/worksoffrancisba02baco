nerally 1 sec it neither put in ure nor put in inquisition, and therefore nore
it for deficient.

ANo TH ER diverfity of method there is, which harh some affinity with
the former, used in some cases by the discretion of the ancients, but diligraceti
fincc by the imposturcs of many vain personS, who have made it as a false
light for their counterfeit merchandises, and that is enigmatical and disclosed.
The pretence whereof is to remove the vulgat capacity troni being admitted
to the secrets of knowledgeS, and to reserve them to felested auditor-S, or wia:
of such sharpncss as can pierce the vcil.

A N o T H ER diverfity of method‚ whercof the consequence is great, is the
delivery of knowledge in aphorisms, or in methods wherein we may ob-
serve, that it hath been too much taken into custom, out of a few axioms or
observations‚ upon any subject, to make a solemn and formal art, filling it
with some discourses, and illustrating it with exampleS, and digesting it into
a senfible method 3 but the writing in aphorisms hath many excellent virtues,
whereto the writing in method doth not approach.

F on first it trieth the writer, whether he bc superficial or solid: for apho-
risms, except they {hould be ridiculous, cannot be made but of the pith and
heart of science33 for discoursc of illustrationis cut off, recitals of examples
are cut off ,- discourse of connection and order is eut off 3 descriptions of practice
are cut off 3 so there remaineth nothing to fill the aphorisms, but some good
quantity of observation: and therefore no man can suffice, nor in reason
will attempt to write aphorisms‚ buthe that is sound and grounded. But in
methods,

Tantum sbries junft‘uraque pollet,
Tantum de medio fitmptz's accedit honoris .-

’Λε a man shall make a great ssiew of an art, which if it were disjointed, would
come to little. Secondly, methods are more fit to win consent or belief,
but less fit to point to astiom for they carry a kind of demonstration in orb
or circle, one part illuminating another, and therefore satisfy. But particu-
lars being disperscd, do best agree with dispersed directions. And lastly, a-
phorisms, representing a knowledge broken, do invite men to inquire farther;
whereas methods carrying the ssiew of a total do secure men, as if they were
at farthest.

A N o Τ H ER diverfity of method‚ which is likewise of great weight, is,
the handling of knowledge by ass'ertions, and thei'r proofs, or by questions
and their determinations ,- the latter kind whereof, if it be immoderately
followed, is as prejudicial to the proceeding of learning, as it is to the pro-
ceeding of an army, to go about to befiege every little fort or hold. F or if
the field be kept, and the sum of the enterprize pursued, those smaller things
will come in of themselves ‚- indeed a man would not leave some important
piece enemy at his back. . In like manner, the use of confutation in the de·
livery of sciences ought to be very sparing ς and to serve to remove strong
preoccupations and prejudgments, and not to minister and excite disputations
and doubts.

A N o τ HE R diversity of methods, is according to the subject or matter
which is handled ς for there is a great diff-erence in delivery of the mathema-
ticks, which are the most abstracted of knoxvledgeS‚ and policy, which is the
. most immersed ς and howsoevcr contention hath been moved, touch·
ing an uniformity of method in multiformity of matter: Yet we see how
that opinion, belides the weakness of it, hath been of ill desert, towards
