oF THE ADVANCEMENT 1351111.

while a mnu praCiiseth teinpeiniice, he doth not prosit much to (ἦ -;11111111ᾗἸ nor
the like: but when he dedicateth and applieth himself to good end-1, look
what virtue soever the pursuit and passhge town-dg those ends doth commend.
unto him, he is invested of a precedent dispolition to conform himself there-
111110 ι which state of mind Aristotle doth excellently express himself, that
it 01111111 1101 10 be called virtuous, bnt divine. His words are these ,- haiim-
nitas} antem censbntanfflm est, opponere eam, quaesispra laath-:armatem· cst,
heroicaiiifive divinam virtfitemss And a little after, >Iam ut fimi· nequae
vitium neque virtus cst, stc neque Dei. Sed hic quidemstiztus altius qaid-
dam virtute cst, ille aliud quiddam a visio. And therefore we may see
what celsitude of honour ‘Plinius fivcandiii· attributeth to Trajan in his 111-
neral oration ,- where he said, “ That men needed to make no other prayers
‘⁶ to the gods, but that they would continue as good lords to them, as T rct-
“ jan had been ;’' as if he had not been only an imitation of divine nature,
but a pattern of it. But these be heathen and prophane passhges, having but
a shadow of that divine state of mind, which religion ι10111110 holy faith doth
conduct men unto, by imprinting upon their souls eharity, which is ex-
cellently called the bond of perfectiori, because it comprehendeth and fasten-v
eth all virtues together. And as it is elegantly said by Menander of vain
love, which is but a false imitation of divine love, Amor melior prhistae
laevo ad humanam vitam, that love teacheth a man to carry himself bet-
ter than the sophist or praeceptor, which he calleth lesthanded, because with
all his rules and preceptions he cannot form a man so dexteroussy, nor with
that facility to prize himself, and govern himself as love can do. So cet-
tainly if a man’s mind be truly enflamed with tharity² it doth work him-
suddenly into greater perfection than all the dostrine of morality can do,
which is but a sophist in comparison of the other. N ay farther‚ as Xeno-
phon observed truly‚ that all other affefflons, though they raise the mind,
yet they do it by distorting, and uncomeliness of ccstafies or exceffes3
but only love doth exalt the mind, and nevertheless at the same instant dorll
settle and compose it: So 111 all other excellentus, though they advance
nature, yet they are subjeci to excess: Only charity admitteth no exeess3
for so wc see, by aspiring to be like God in power, the angels transgressed
and fell ,- Ascendam, όν erofimilis Altiffimo. By aspir-ing to be like God
in knowledge, man transgreffed and fcll; Eritis ficut Dii, fi·ientes bonum
ὢ malum .· But by aspiring to a fimilitude of God in goodness or love,-
neither man nor angel ever transgress'ed‚ or {hall transgress. For 111110 that
imitation we are called3 Diligite inimicos vestros, benefacite eis ui ode-
runt vos, dy orate pro perstqiientibus &³ calumniantibus vos iit itis filii
‘Patris vestri qui in coelis cst, qm· sblem fitam oriri facit fiiper bonos όν
malos, ὠ· pluit ssiperjtzstos <sy- injustos. So in the first platform of the
divine nature it self, the heathen religion speaketh thus, Optimus M'aximus 3
and the sacred scriptures thus, lilifhricordia ejus snper omnia opera ejus.

W H ER F„ F o R E 1 do conclude this part of moral knowledge concerning
the culture and regiment of the mind3 wherein if any man, confidering the
parts thei-eof, which Ihave enumerated‚ do judge, that my labour is but to
colle& into an art or science, that which hath been pretermitted by others, as
matters of common sense and expericncc‚ he judgeth well: But as Philo-
crates spotted with Demosthenes, “ You may not marvel (Athenium) that
“ ‘Demosthenes and Ι do differ, for he drinketh water, and 1 drink winelss
An'd like as we read of an ancient pai-able of the two gates of sseep,
