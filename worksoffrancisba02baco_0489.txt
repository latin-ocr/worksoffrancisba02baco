ACAIN. 'ny the knowledge of physical causeS, there cannot fail to fol-
low many indications and designations of new particular-s, if meniu their
speculation will keep one eye upon use and practice. But these are but
coastings along the shore, ‘Prememlo littus iniquum, for it seemeth tome,
there can hardly be discovered any radical or fundamental alterations and
innox-anons in nature, either by the fortune and essiiys of experiments, or
by the light and direelion of physical cauli-s.

pathieS, and antipathies‚ and hidden proprieties‚ and some frivolous ex-
periments, strange rather by disguisement, than in themselves: It is as far
differing in truth of nature, from such a knowledge as we require, as the
story of king Arthur of Britain or Hugh of Burdeaux, differs from Cae-
l'ar's commentariesin truth of story. For it is manifest that Caesizr did greater

=things cle vero, than those imaginat-y heroes were feign'd to do ‚- buthe did

them not in that fabulous manner. Of this kind of learning the fable of
Ixion was a figure, who designed to enioy Juno the goddess of powcr3
aud instead of her had copulation with a cloud, of which mixture were be-
gotten centaurs and chimaeras.

S o whosoever {hall entertain high and vaporous iinaginati01iS‚ instead of

,a laborious and sober inquiry of truth, shall beget hopes and beliefs of

strange and impoiiible ffiapes. And therefore we may note in these sciences,
which hold so much of imagination and belief, as this degenerare natural
magick, alchymy, astrology, and thelike‚ that in their propositions‚ thede-
scription ofthe means, is ever more monstrous than the pretence or end.

Forit is a thing more probable‚ that he that knoweth well the natures
of weight, of colour, of pliant and fragile in respeet of the hammer,
of volatile and fixt in respect of the fire, and the rest, may superin-
duee upon some metal the nature and form of gold by such mecha·
m‘ck as longeth to the *produffion of the natures afore rehearsed, than
that some grains of the medicine projested, {hould in a few moments
of time, turn a sea of quickfilver or other material into gold: So it is
more probablc, that he that knoweth the nature of arefastion, the nature
of assimilation, of nourilhment to the thing nouriihed, the manner of in-
crease and clearing of spirits, the manner of the depredations which spi—
rits make upon the humour-s and solid parts; shall, by ambages of diets,
bathings, anoindngs, medicines, morioris, and the like, ptolong life, or
restore some degrees of youth or vivacity, than that it can be done
with the use of a few drops, or scruples of a liquor or receipt. To eon-
clude therefore, the true natural magick‚ which is that great liberty and
latitude of operation, which dependeth upon the knowledge of forms, 1
‘may report deficient, as the relative thereofis3 to which part, if we be
serious and incline not to vanities and plausible discourse‚ besides the de-
riving and deducing the operations themselves from metaphyfick‚ there are
pertinent two points of much purpose, the one by way of preparation, the
other by way of cantion: The first is, that there be made a kalendar re-
sembling an inventory of the estate of man, containing all the inventious‚ .
(being the works or fruits of nature or art) which are now extant, and gnffitffizffl
whereof man is already poiseffed, out of which doth naturally result a note, „frum Τ
