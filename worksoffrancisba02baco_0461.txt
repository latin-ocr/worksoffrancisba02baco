Bookl. OF LEARNING.

harh, hc will Iearn 10 shew to the full, and use 1110111 dexteroussy, but not
much to enci-ease them. The faults 110 113111, 110 will 103111 how to hide and
colour them, but not much to amend them: like an ill mower, that xnows
on still, and never whets his scythe3 whereas with the learned man it 111105
Otherwise, that 110 doth ever intermix the corrcCtion and amendment os his
mind, 111111 1110 use and employment thereos. N ay farther in general and in
sum, certain it is, that veritas and bonitas differ, but as the scal and the print :
for truth prints goodness, and they be the clouds of error, which descend in
the storms of paffions and perturbations.

F R 0 Μ 1110131 virtue, let us pass on to matter of p'ower and commandmcnt,
*and consider whether in right reason there be any comparable with that
wherewith knowledge investeth ancl crowneth man’s nature. VVee sec the
'dignity of the commandment, is according to the dignity of the command-
'ed ι 10 have commandment over beasts as herdmen have, is 3 thing contemp-
tib1e; to have commandment over children, as schoolmasters have, is 3 11131-
'ter of [1113111101101115 to have commandment over galley-ssaves‘, is a dispa-
ragement rather than an honour. Neither is the commandment of tyrants
much better over people which have put off the generosity of their minds ;
‘and therefore it was ever holden, that honours in free monarchies and.
commonwealths had a sweetness more than in tyrannies, because the
'commandment extendeth more over the wills of 111011, and not only over
'their deeds and services. And therefore when Virgil putteth himself forth
to attribute to Angustus Caefizr the best of human honours, he doth itin

'these words 5
. Δ , W'ft'orqne volentei- .
Per populos dat jura, viamque affidat Olympo.

Bur yet the commandm'ent of knowledge is yet higher 111311 1110 001114,
mandinent over the will; for it is a commandment over the reason, belief
and understanding of man, which is the highest part of the mind, and giveth
law to the will it sclf: for there is 110 power on 031111 which sett'eth up a throne
or 011311· of state in the spirits ‘and souls of men, and in their cogitations, 11113-
ginations, opinions ‘c'lnd beliefs, but knowledge and learning. And therefore
We sce the detestable and extreme pleasure that arch-hereticks, ‘and false pro-
vphem, and imposiOrs 310 'transported with, when they once find in themselves
’11131 they have a superiority in the saith and conscience of men5 so great, as
if they have once tasted of it, itis seldom seen that any torture or persecu-
tion 0311 make them relinquiffi or abandon it. But as this is that Which the
31111101· of th'e Revelation 03110111 1110 depth or profoundness of satan, so by
argument of contraries, the just and lawful sovereignty over mens> under-
standing, by force of truth rightly interpreted‚ is that which approacheth
'nearest to the similitude of the divine rule. x Η

Αε for fortune and advanc'ement‚ the beneficence of learning is Ι1101 so
eonfincd to give fortune only to states and commonwealths‚ 35 11 doth not
likewise give fortune to particular persons. For it was well noted long ago,
that Homer harh given more men their livings, than either Sylla, or Caesbzr,
‘or Augustus ever did, notwithstanding their great largeffes and donatives
:md distributions of lands to so many legionsj and no doubt it 15 hard to say,
whether 311115 or learning ha'vc advanced greater numbers. And in case of
'sovereignty we see, that if arms or descent have carried away the kingdom,
yet learning hath carried the priesthood, which ever hath been in some com-
petition with empire. ’
