BookIL OF LEARNINOE 343*

that which doth infallibly make the body of seienecs more immense in quantity
and more base in substance. '

AN D for strength, it is true, that knowledges reduced into exast methods
have a sticw of strength, in that each part secmeth to support and sustam
the otiien but this is more satisfactory than substantial‚ like unto buildinos
who stand by architectum and eompaffion, which are more subject Oto,
ruiti, than those which are built more strong in their several parts, though
less compasted. But it is plain, that the more you recede from yoiir
grounds, the weaker do you conclude3 and asin nature, the more you re-
move your self from particular-s, the greater peril of error you do incur:
So much more in divinity‚ the more you recede from the scriptur-cs
by inferenccs and consequences, the more wcak and dilute are your post-
tions.

Am> as for perfeetion or compleatness in divinity‚ it is not to be fought,
which makes this course of artificial divinity the more suspect. For he
that will reduce a knowledge into an art, will make it round and uniform:
but in divinity many things must be left abrupt and eoncludcd with this:
Oaltitudo sapientiae &scientiae Dei ! quam incomprehenffbilia simt judicia
ejus, &¹noninvcstzgabilesviaeejus? Soagainthe apostle saith, Expartesci-
mus; and to have the foi-m of a total where there is but matter for a part,
cannot be without supplies by supposition and presumption. And there-fore
1 conclude, that the true use of these sums and method harh place in institu-
tions or introductions preparatory unto knowledge3 but in them, or -by di-
ducement from them, to handle the main body and substance of a know-
1edge, is in all sciences prejudicial and in divinity dangerous.

As to the interpretation of the scriptures solute and at large, there have
been divers kinds introduced and devised3 some of them rather curious and
unsafe than sober and warranted. Notwithstanding thus much must be
eonfeffed, that the scriptures being given by inspiration‚ and not by human
reason, do differ from all other books in the author-3 which by consequence
doth draw on forne difference to be used by the expositor, For the inditer‘
of them did know four things which no man attains to know3 which are
'the mysteties of the kingdom of glot-y, the perfectiori of the laws of na-
ture, the secrcts of the heart of man, and the future succeffion of all ages.
For. as to the first, it is said, He that prcffes into the light, shall be oppresffi’d
of the glotsy. And again, No manfhall fi'e my face and live. To the second,
thW he prepared the heavens I was present, when by law and compaſse he en-
clofid the deep. To the third, N either was it needful that any should bear
witnesi· to him of man, for he knew well what was in man. And to the last,
From the beginning are known to the Lord all his worksi

FRoM the former of these two have been drawn certain senses and expost-
'tions of scriptures‚ which had need be contained within the bounds of so-
briety3 the one anagogical, and the other philosophical. But as to the for-
mer, man is not to prevent his time3 Videmus nunc per speculum in aemg-
mate‚ tunc autem facie ad faciem3 wherein nevertlieless thereseemcth to be
a liberty granted, as far forth as the polissiing of this glass‚ or some mode-
rate explication of this aentgma. But to press too far into it cannot but
cause a diss'olution and overthrow of the spirit of man: for in the body
there are three degrces of that we receive into it, alimem, medicine and-
poison3 whereof alimentis that which the nature of man can pcrfeffly al-

ter and overcome3 medicine is that which is partly convertcd by nature, arpi-
part y
