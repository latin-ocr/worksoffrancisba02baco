BookII. OF LEARNING.

far excel all -the other ways3 yet because this part conecrneth‚ as it were, the
mint of knowledge, (for words arethe tokens current and accepted for con-
ceits‚ as moneys are for values, and that it is f1t men be not ignorant, that mo-
neys may be of another kind than gold and filver) l thought good to propound
it to better inquiry.

CON c E R Nl NG speech and words, the consideration of them hath pro-
duced the science of grammar; for man still striveth to reintegrate himself
in those bcnediffions, from which by his fault hc hath been deprived: and as
he hath strivcn against the first general curse, by the invention of all other
arts; so hath he fought to come forth of the second general curse (which
was the confusion of tongues) by the art of grammar, whereof the use in a
mother tongue is small; in a foreign tongue more3 but most in such fo-
reign tongues as have ceascd to be vulgar tongues, and are turned only to
learned tongues. The duty of it is of two natures; the one popular, which
is for the speedy and perfect attaining oflanguages, as well for intercourse ot*
speech, as for understanding of authors; the other philosophical, examin-
ing the power and nature of words, as they are the footsteps and prints of
⁴ reason: which kind of analogy between words and reason, is handled spar-
fim, brokenly, though not entire1y3 and therefore I cannot report it de-
ficient, though l think it is very worthy to bc reduced into a science by·
it self.

U N To grammar also belongeth, as an appendix, the consideration of the
accidents of words,which ate measure, found, and elevation or accent, and the
sweetness and harshness of them ε whence hath iss'ued some curious observa-
tions in rhetorick‚ but chiefly poesy, as we consider it, in respeft of the
verse, and not ofthc argumcnt3 wherein though men in learned tongues do
tye themselves to the ancient measures, yet in modern languages it secmeth
to me, as free to make new measures of verses, as of dance53 for adancc is a
measured pace, asaverse is a measured speech. ln these things the sense is
better judge than the art5

Fon cipherS, they are commonly in letters or alphabets, but may be in
words The kinds of ciphers, (besides the simple ciphers, with changes, and
intermixtures of nulls and non-fignificants) are many, according to the na-
ture or rule of the infoulding: wheel-eiphers, key-cipherS, doubleS, &a But
the virtues of thern, whereby they arc to be preferred, are three3 that they be
not laborious to write and rcad3 that they be impostible to dccipher ‚- and in
some cases, that they be without suspicion. The highest degree whereof is
to write omnia per omnia 3 which is undoubtedly poffible with a proportion
quincuple at most, of the writing infoulding, to the writing infoulded, and
no other restraint whatsoever. This art of ciphering hath for relative an art
of deciphcring, by supposition unprofitable, but, as things are, of great use.
For suppose that ciphers were well managed, there be multitudes of them
which exclude the dccipherer. But in regard of the rawness and unskilful-
ness of the hands through which they pass, the greatest matters arc many
times carried in the wcakest ciphers.
