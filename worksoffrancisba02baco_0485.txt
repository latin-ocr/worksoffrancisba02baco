γ13001111. OF LEARN1NG. 4η

Fon metaphyliek, we have assigned unto it the enquiry of formal 31111

J final 63111655 which 3111311311011, as ro the formet of thern, may seem to be
nugatory and void, because of the received and inveterate opinions, that the
inquisition of 111311 151101· competent to find out cilentinl sormS, ,or true dis<
1-’61-611665, of which opinion we will take this holdz 11131 the invention os
forms is ofall otherparts ofknowledge the worthiest ro be 10113111, ifit be
poffible 10 be found. ⁹

As for the postibility‚ they 316 111 discover-crs that think there is no land,
when they can see nothing but sen.

ΒΗΤ itis manifest, that Plato in his opinion of ideas, 35 0116 that had 3
wit of elevation 11111316 35 upon 3 cliff, did dese-ry, “ Thnt forms were the
“ true object of knowledge? butlost the real fruit ofhis opinion, by con-
fidering of forms 35 absolutely 311111361611 from matter, 31111 1101 confined and
determined by matter: and so turning 1115 opinion upon theolog-ty, where-
with all his natural philosophy 15 111Ε6616ς1.

Bur if any 111311 111311 keep a continual watchful and severe eye upon
action, operation, and the use of knowledge, he may advise 31111 take notice

- what are the forms, the disclosures whereof 316 1111111111 31111 important to
the -state of man. For as to the forms of substances, (111311 only except,)
of whom 11 is said, Formavit hominem de limo terrae, 63⁹ spiravit in faciem
ejus spiraculum vitae, and not as of all other 6163111165, *Producant aquae,
producat terra, the forms of substances‚ I say (35 they 316 now by com-
pounding and transplanting multiplied) 316 so perplexed, 35 they 316 not to
be enquired3 no more 111311 11 were either poffible or to purpose, to scel< in ·
gross the forms of those sounds which make words, which by composition
and transpofition of letters are infinite. '

ΒΗΤ 011 the 0111611136, to enquire the form of those sounds or voices,
which make simple letters, is easily comprehensiblcs and being known, in—
duceth and manifesteth the forms of words, which consist and are com-
pounded of them: in the fame manner to enquire the form of 3 11011, of
an oak, of gold3 nay, of water, of air, is 3 vain pursuit: But to enquire
the forms of sense, of voluntary motion, of vegetation, of 60101115, of gra-
vity and 16111γ, of denssty, of tenuity‚ of 11631, of cold3· and 311 other 113-
tures and 3113111165, which like an alphabet 316 not many, and of which the
effenccs (upheld by matter) of all 6163111165 do confist: To enquire‚ I
fay, the true forms of these, 15 that part of metaphyfick‚ which we now
define of.

Nor but that phyfick doth make enquiry, 31111 take consideration of the
same natures: but how? Only 35 10 1116 1113161131 31111 efficient causes of
them, and not as to the forms. For example3 if the cause of whiteness
in snow or froth be enquired, and it be render'd thus3 That the subtile in-
termixture of air and water is the cause, it is well render'd3 but neverthe-
less, is this the form of whiteness? No3 but it is the efficient, which is ever
but vehiculum formae.

Tms part of metapliyfickI do not find laboured 31111 performed, where- Metaplgyfici
at I marvel not: because I hold it not poffible to be invented by that course {vffizumr'ss'
of invention which hath been used, in rcgard that men (which is the rootrum.
of all error) have maele too untimely a departure, and too remote a recess
from particulars.

Bur the use of this part of metaphyfick which 1 report 35 deficient, 15
of the rest the most excellent in two respec'ts: theone, because it is the du-
ty and virtue of all knowledge to abridge the infinity of individual expe-
