ther in the smeercness of the fruiti0n‚ or in the quickness and vigour of it ς
the one superinduced by equaliry, the other by vicissitude3 the one having
less mixture of evil, the other more impression of good. W hethei· of these
is the greater good, is a question controvertcd3 but whether man's nature may
not be capable of both, is a question not inquired.

T 1-1 E former question being debated between Socrates and a sophist, So-
crates placing felicity in an equal and constant peace of mind, and the sophist
in much defiring and much enjoying, they fell from argument to ill words :
the sophist saying that Socrates's felicity was the felicity of a block or stone,
and Socrates saying that the sophist's felicity was the felicity of one that had
the itch, who did nothing but itch and scratch. And both these opinions do
not want their supports ε for the opinion of Socrates is much upheld by the
general consent even of the Epicur-es themselves, that virtue beareth a great
part in felicity ε and if so, certain it is, that virtue hath more use in clearing
perturbations than in compassing defu-es. The sophist's opinion is much fa-
voured by the assei-tion we last spake off, that good of advancemcnt is greater
than good of simple preservations because every obtaining a desire harh a
> {hew of advancement, as motion though in a circle hath a ihew of pro-
gression. Δ ⁷

BU T the second question, decided the true way, maketh the former su-
perfluous: for can it be doubted but that there are some who take more plea-
sure in enjoying plcafiires than some other, and yet nevertheless are less trou-
bled with the loss or leaving of them ,ς so as this same, Αἴθη nti, ut non ap-
petas ‚· non appetere, nt non metuam fimt animi plfilli <sy dt'ffi'dentis. And
it seemeth to me, that most of the doctrines of the philosophcrs are more
fearful and cautionary than the nature of things requircth : so have they cn-
creascd the fear of death in offering to cure -it 3 for when they would have a
mau's whole life to be but a discipline or preparation to die, ,they must needs
make men think that it is a terrible enemy against whom there is no end of
‚prcparing Better saith the poet,

. {lui finem vitae extremum inter manera ponat
aturae .·

So vhave they fought to make mens minds too uniform and harmonieal² by
not breaking them sufficiently to contrary ‚motions: the reason whereof'I
suppose to be, because they themselves were men dedicated to a private, free,
and unapplied course of life. For as we see, upon thelute or like instru-
ment, a ground, though it be sweet and have shew of many change8‚ yet
breaketh not the hand to such strange and hard stops and passages as >a set
song or voluntary ; much' after the same manner was the diver-fity between a
philosophical and a civil life. And therefore men are to imitate the w'isclom
of jewellers, who if there be a grain, or ancloud‚ or an ice which may be ground
forth without taking too much of the stone,> they help it ‚- but if it ssiould
lessen andabate the stone-too much, they will not meddle with it3 so ought
men so to procure serenity, as they destroy not magnanimity.

HA v1 N G therefore deduced the good of man, which is private and parti-
cular, as far as seemeth fit, we will now return to that good of man which
respe&eth and beholdeth society, which 5we may term duty 3 because the
term of duty is more proper to a mind well framed and disposed towards o-
thers, as the-term ,of virtue is applyed to a mind well formed and eomposed

in itself5 though neither can a man understand virtue without some rela-
