'well‚ for their present use3 but the spring-head thereof seemeth to me not
to have been vifited; being of so excellent use, both for the disclofing of
nature, and the abridgment of art.

THIS scicnce being therefore first placed as a common parent, like unto
Bereqynthia‚ which had so much heavenly iss'ue‚ Omnes coelicolas, omnes sit-
pra alta tenentes, we may return to the former distribution of the three phi-
losophies, divine, natural and human.

Am> as concerning divine philosophy, or natural theology‚ it is that
knowledge or rudiment of knowledge concerning God, which may be
obtained by the contemplation of his creatures; which knowledge may be
truly termed divine, in respect of the object, and natural in respeest of the
light. q

Tm: bounds of this knowledge are, that it sufficeth to convince atheism‚
but not to «inform religion: and therefore there was never miracle wrought
by God to convert an atheist‚ because the light of nature might have led
him to confess a God: but miracles have been wrought to convert idolaters
and the superstitious, because no light of nature extendeth to declare the
will and true worship of God.

Fon as all works do lhew forth the power and skill of the workman,
and not his image, so it is of the works of God, which do shew the omni-
potency and wisdom of the maker, but not his image3 and therefore there-
in the heathen opinion differeth from the sacred truth3 for they supposed
the world to be the image of God, and man to be an exn-an or compendi-
ous image of the world: but the scriptures never vouchsafe to attri-
bute to the world that honour, as to be the image of God, but only the
work of his hands; neither do they spcak of any other image of God, but
man: wherefore by the contemplation of nature, to induce and inforce t
acknowledgement of God, and to demonstrate his power, providence and
goodness, is an excellent argument, and harh been excellently handled by
divers.

Bur on the other fide, out of the contemplation of nature, or ground os
human knowledgcs, to induce any verity or persuasion concerning the points
of faith, is in my judgment not* safe: ‘Da fidei, quae fidei fient. For the
heathen themselves conclude as much in that excellent and divine fable of
the golden chain3 “ That men and gods were not able to draw Jupiter
“ down to the carth3 but contrariwise‚ Jupiter was able to draw them up
“ to heaven.'’

So as we ought not to attempt to draw down or submit the mysteries ot'
God to our rcas0n3 but contrat-nvnc, to raise and advance our reason to the
