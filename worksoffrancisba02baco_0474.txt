OF THE ADVANCEMENT 1300le

ther name of Britain, as a full period of all instability and peregrinations:
So that as it cometh to pass in maliire bodies, that they have certain trepida-

· tions and warerings before they fix and settle,⁸ so it teemeth that by the provi.

dence of God this monarchy, before it was to settle in your majesty and your
generations, (in which Ihope it is now establilhed for ever) vit had these pre-
lulire changes and varieties.

Fon lives ,- ldo find strange that these times have so little esteemed the
vii-tues of the times, as that the writings oflires should be no more frequent.
For although there bc not many sovereign princes or absolute comman-
derS, and tliat states are most collected into monarchicS, yet are there ma-
ny worthy personagcs that deserve better than disperscd report‚ or barsen
elogics: For herein the invention of one of the late poets is proper, and
doth well inrich the ancient fiction ,- for he seigneth, that at the end of
the thread or web of every man’s lise there was a little medal containing the
person's name, and that time waited upon the lhears; and as soon as the
thread was cut, caught the medals, and carried thern to the river of
Lethe ‚- andabout the bank there were many birds flying up and down,
that would <aet the medals and carry them in their beak a little while,
and then let them fall into the river: Only there were a few swans,
which if they got a name, would carry it to a temple, where it was
consecrated.

AND although many men more mortal in their affeffions than in their
bodies, do esteem desire of name and memory but as a vanity and ventosity3

Animi nil magnae laudis egentes.

Which opinion cometh from the root, IVonprius laudes contempstm}ts‚ quam
laudanda facere desivimus .· yet that will not alter Solomon's judgmcnt‚ Me-
moria justi cum laudibus, at impiorum nomen putrefiet: the one flourilh-
eth, the other either consu-merli to present oblivion, or turneth to an ill
&doun

A Νι) therefore in that style or addition, which is and hath been long well
received and brought in use, Felicis memoriae, piae memmae, honae me-
moriae, we do acknowledge that which Cicero saith, borrowing it from De-
mosthenes, that Bona fama propria poſjc'ffi'o defimfft'orum ,- which poss'effion
Icannot·but note, that in our times it lieth much waste, and that therein‘
there is a deficience.

F o R narrations and relations of particular aetions, there were also to be
wished a greater diligence thercins for there is no great action but hath some
good pen which attends it.

AND because it is an ability not commonly to write a good history, as
may well appear by the small number os them3 yet if particularity of
affions memorable, were but tolerably reported as they pass, the compiling
of a complete history of times might be the better expected, when a writer
{hould arise that· were fit for its for the collection of such relations might be
as a nursery garden, whereby to plant a fait and stately garden, when time
should serve.

THE R E is yet another partition of history⁴ which Cornelius Tacitus ma-
keth, which is not to be forgotten, especially with that application which
lie accomplisheth it withal, annals and journals, appropriating to the former,
matters of state3 and to the latter, ads and accidents os a meaner nature.
For giving but a touch of certain magnificent buildings, he addeth, Cum
