being learned, incline to the traditions of experience‚ or being empiricks,

IN preparation of medicinesl dofindstrange, especially, considering‘how
mineral mcdicines have been extolled3 and that they are safer >for the out-
ward than inward parts, that no man hath fought to make an imitation by
art of natural baths, and medicinable fountain53 which nevertheless are
confess'ed to receive their virtues from minerals; and not so only, but dis-
cerned and distinguished from what particular mineral they receive tinam-c,
as sulphur, vitriol, steel, or the like3 which nature, if it may be reduced
to compofitions of art, both the variety of them will be increased, and the
temper of them will be more commanded.

Bur lest 1 ‹gi-ow to be mote particular than is agreeable, either to my
intention or to proportion; Ι will conclude this part with the note of one
deficienee more, which seemeth to me of greatest consequenee3 which is,
that the prescripts in use are too compendious to attain their ends for-to
my understanding, it is a vain and flattering opinion to think any medi-
cine can be so fover-eign, or so happy, as that the reccipt or use of itcan
work any great effe& upon the body of man: it were a strange speech,
which spoken, or spoken oft, lhould reclaim a man from vice to which
he were by nature subjeet3 it is order, pursuit, sequence, and interchange
of application, which is mighty in nature3 which although it require more
exa& knowledge in preseribing, and more precise obedience in observing,
vet is recompensed with the magnitude of effects. And althougha man
‘would think by the daily visitations of the physicians, that there were a
put-suanee in the cures yet let a man look into their prescripts and mini—
strations, and he shall find them but inconstancies, and every day's devi-
ses without any settled providcnce or projee‘ss not that every scrupulous
or superstitious prescript is effeetual, no more than every straight way is
the way to heaven, but the truth of the direction must precede severity of
observance. .

Fon cosmetick, it hath parts civil and parts effeminate: for cleanness
of body was ever cstecmed to proceed from a due. reverence to God, ro
society, and to our selves. As for artificial decoration, it is well worthy
of the deficiences which it hath3 being neither fine enough to deceive, not
handsome to use, nor wholesome to plcase.

Fon athletick, Ital<e the subjest of it largely, that is to say, for any point
of ability, whereunto the body of man may be brought, whether it be of
activity, or of patience3 whereof ae'tivity hath two parts, strength and
liviftncss: And patience likewise hath two parts, hardness against wants and
extremitiCS, and indurance of pain or torment, whereof we see the practices
in tumblers, in stringes, and in those that suffer punissiment: Nay, if there
be any other faculty which falls not within any of the former divisions, as
in those that dive, that obtain a strange power of containing respiration and
the like, 1 refer it to this part. Of these things the practices are known,-
but the philosophy that concerneth them is nor much inquiredz the ra-
ther I think, because they are supposed to be obtained, either hy an apt-
ness of nature, which cannot be taught, or only by continual eustom,
which is soon prescribed3 which though it be not anie, yet 1 sorbeat to
note any deficienceS, for the Olympian games are down long fince, and
the mediocrity of these things is for use3 as for the excellency of them, it
serveth for the most part but fot mercenary ostentation. ⁴
