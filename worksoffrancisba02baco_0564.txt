recognizance, until Mr. Egerton threatened to complain thereos ωηο the
king.

HE shewed also that the eommons do purpose that if any more ofthis
kind happen to be complained of before them, they will present the same
to your lordships, wherein they shall follow the ancient precedent& which
lhew that great persons have been accused for the lil<e in parliament.

THEY humbly desire that forasmuch as this eoncerneth a person of sos
great eminency‚ it may not depend long before your lordlhips, that the
examination of the proofs may be expedited, and if he be found guilty,
then to be punished5 isnot guilty, the now accusers to be punished.

THIS being reported, the lord admiral presented to the housea letter
written unto their lordssiips‚ the tenour whereof following, viz. as printed
Vol. IV. p. 685.

U1‘0N which letter answer was sent from the lords unto the said lord
chancellor on the said twentieth of March, viz. that the lords received his
lordlhip's letter, delivered unto them by the lord admiral, they intend. to
proceed in his cause now before their lordships, according to the right rulc of
justice, and they {hall be glad if his lordlhip shall clear his honour therein3
to which end they pray his lordship to provide for his just defenee.

AND afterwards, on I‘Vednffdqy the twenty first of March, the eommons
sent a mess'age unto the lords concerning their further complaim: against the
said lord chancellor, which consisted of these four points, viz.

THE first in chancery being between the lady Wharton plaintiff, and Wood
and others defendantS, upon cross bills‚ the lord chancellor upon hearing
wholly dismiss‘ed them3 but upon entry of the order, the eross bill against
the lady tharton was only diliniffed: and afterwards, sor a bribe of 300 l.
given by the lady Wharton to the lord chancellor, his lordlhip deereed the
cause farther‚ and then hearing that lVood and the other defendants com-
plained thereof to the house of commons, his lordship sent for them, and
danmed that deeree as unduly gotten3 and when the lady Wharton began
to complain thereof, his lordlhip sent for her also, and promised her redress,
saying, that deeree is not yet entred.

SECONDLY‚ in a suit between Hall plaintiff, and Holman defendant3
Holman deferring his answcr, was committed to the fleet, where he lay
twenty weeks‚ and petitioning to be delivered, was answered by some about
the lord chancellor, the bill {hall be deereed against him (pro confeffo)
unless he would enter into a 2000 l. bond to stand to the lord chancellor¹s
order3 Which he refusing, his liberty eost him one way or other one thou-
sand pounds. Holman being freed out of the fleet, Hall petitioned to the
lord chancellor, and Holman finding his cause to go hard with him on his
fide, complained to the commons3 whereupon the lord chancellor sent for
him, and to pacify him, told him he should have what order he would

himself.

T H 1 R D LY, in the cause between Smithwicke and lViche, the matter in que—
stion being for accounts with the merchant, to whom it was referred, certified
in the behalf of Smithwicke, yet Smithwicke to obtain a deeree, was told
by one Mr. Burrough, one neat to the lord chancellor, that it must eost
him 200l. which he paid to Mr. Burrough or Mr. Hunt, to the use of
the lord chancellor3 and yet the lord chancellor deereed but one part of
the certificat& Whereupon he treats again with Mr. Burrough‚ who de-
manded another 100 l. which Smithwicke also paid to the use of the lord
chancellor, Then his lordssiip referred the accounts again to the same

merchant,
