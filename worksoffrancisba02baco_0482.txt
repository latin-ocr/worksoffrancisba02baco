divine truth. So as in this part of knowledge, toneliing divine philosophy,
I 3111 so far from noting any 116116161166, asi rather note 311 6κ661ὲς where-
unto l have digress'cd, because of the extreme prejudiee which both religion
and philosophy hath received, and may receive, by being commixed toge-
ther3 as that which undoubtedly will make 311 1161611631 religion, and 311
imaginary and fabulous philosophy.

OTHERWISE it is of the nature of angels and spirits, which is an ap-
pendix of theology, both divine and natural, and is neither inscrutable not*
interdieccd: for although the scripture saith, Let πο man deceiveyou in sisb-
lt'me disboursb touching the wofffhl'p ofangels, prqllt'ng into that he know-eth
not, &e yet notwithstanding if you observe weil that precept, it may ap-
pear thereby‚ that there be two things only forbidden, adorat-ion of rhem,
and opinion fantastical of them, either to extol them, farther than apper-
taineth to the degree of a creature, 01· 10 extol a man's knowledge of them,
farther than he 113111 ground.

Bur the sober 31111 grounded enquiry, which may arise out of the pas-
sages of holy scriptures, or out of the 111-3113110115 of nature, is not restrain-
ed: so of degenerare and revolted spiritS, the converfing with them, or the
cmployment of them is prohibited, much more any veneration towards
them. But the contemplation or scicnce of their nature, their power, their
illusionS, either by scripture or reason, is a part o'f spiritual wisdom. For
so the Apostle saith, We are not ignorant ffhisstratagems. Auditis no
more unlawsul to inquire the nature of evil spirits, 111311 to inquire the¹
force of poisons in nature, or thc nature of fin and vice 111 morality3 but
this part touching angels and spirits, Ι 63111101 11016 35 deficient, fot many
have occupied themselves in it: Ι may rather challenge it in many of 1116
writers thereos, as fabulous and fantastical. v

L E A v 1 N G therefore divine philosophy or natural theology, (not divinity or
inspired theology, which we reserve for the last of all, as the haven and
sabbath of all man's contemplations,) we will now proceed to natural phi-
losophy: lf then it be true that Democritus said, “ That the truth of na-‘i
‘⁴ ture lieth hid 111 certain deep mines and caves: Α

AND if it be true likewise, that the alchymists do so much inculeare,- that
Vulcan is a second nature, and imitateth that dextroussy and 60111-
pendioussy, Which nature worketh by ambages, 31111 length of 1111165 11 were
good to divide natural philosophy into the mine and the furnace, and to
make two 111-0161110115 or occupations of natural philosophers, some to be pio-
neers, and some smith53 some to dig, and some to retine 31111 hammer: and
surely 1 do best allow of a division of that kind, though in more familiar
and seholastical ternis: namely, that these bc the two parts of natural philo-
sophy, the inquisition of causes, and· the 111-0311811011 of effest83 speculative
and operative, natural science, and natural prudence.

FOR as in civil matters there is 3 wisdom of discourse, *and a wisdom of
directi0n3 so is it in natural. And here Ι will make a request, that for the
later (or at least for a part thereof) Imay revive and reintegrate the mis-
applied and abusccl name of natural magick, which in the true sense is but
natural wisdom, or natural 111-1111611665 taken according to the ancient ac-
ception, purged from vanity and superstition.

N 0 1ν although it be true, and 1 know 11 well, that there is an cntercourse
between causes and effects, so as both these knowledges, speculative and
operative, have a great connection between themselves yet because all true
and fruitful natural philosophy hath a double scale or laddcr, ascendent and

descendent,
