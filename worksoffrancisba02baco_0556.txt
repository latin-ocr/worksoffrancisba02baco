542 OF THE ADVANCEMENT Book-11.

sufficiency of the information belong two consideration& what points of re-
lizion arc fundamental, and what perfeeiivq being matter offarther build-
inz and perfectiori upon one and the lame foundati0n3 and again, how the
gradations of light, according to the disposition of timcS, are material to the
sufficiency of belief. .

HERE again I may rather give it in advice, than note it as deficient,
De. ἓζῖἀῑῖῗὲἶ that the points fundamental, and the points of fai-ther perfectiori, only
ffissffebgif ought to be with piety and wisdom distinguisheds a subjest tending to

much like end, as that 1 noted before3 for as that other were likely to abate
the number of controversies, so this is like to abate thc heat of many of
them. We sec llffosbs when he saw the Ι fiaelites and the AEga'ptians sight, he
did not say, thystriveyou? but drew his swerd, and ssew the AEgyptian:
but when he saw the two Israelites fight, he said, Yon are brethren, why
stri-ve you? If the point of doctrine be an AEgyptian, it must be ssain by the
‘sword of the spirit, and not reconciled: But ifit be an Istaelite, though in
the wrongs then, Why stri-veyou? XsVe see of the fundamental points, our
Saviour penneth the league thus; He that is not with τις, is against us ‚- but
ofpoints not fundamental, thus; He that is not against ns, is with us. So
we see the coat of our Saviour was entire without seam, and so is the doe-
trine of the scripturcs in it self; but the garment of the church was of
divers colours, and yet not dlvided3 we see the chaff may and ought to be
severed from the corn in the ear, but the tares may not be pulled up from
the corn in the field. So as it is a thing of great use well to define, what,
and of what latitude those points are, which do make men merely aliens
and disineorporate from the church of God.

F on the obtaining of the information, it resteth upon the true and found
interpretation of the scriptures‚ which are the fountains of the water of
life. The interpretations of the scriptures are of two sorts: methodieal',
and solute or at large. For this divine water, which excelleth so much
that of Jacob's well, is drawn forth much in the same kind, as natural wa-
ter useth to be out of wells and fountains; either it is first forced up into a
cistern, and from thence fetch'd and derived for use3 or else it is drawn
and received in buckets and vess'els immediately where it springeth. The
former sort whereof, though it seem to be the more ready, yet in my
judgment is more subject to corrupt. This is that method which hath ex-
hibited unto us the scholastical divinity‚ whereby divinity harh been redu-
ced into an art, as into a cistern‚ and the streams of doctrine or positions
fetch'd and derived from thence.

IN this men have fought three things, a summai-y brevity‚ a compateted
strength, and a complete perfeffiom whereof the two first they fail to find,
and the last they ought not to seek. For as to brevity, we see in all sum-
mary methodS, while men purpose to abridge, they give cause to dilate.
For the sum or abridgment by contrastmn becometh obscure; the obscurity
requireth exposition, and the exposition is deduced into large commenta-
ries, or into common places and tides, which grow to be more vast than
the original writings‚ whence the sum was at first extraded. So we see
the volumcs of the school-men are greater much than the first wri-
tings of the fathers, whence the master of the sentences made his
sum or collection. So in like manner the volumes of the modern do&ors
of the civil law execed those of the ancient jurisconsults, of which T rebo-
man compiled the digest. So as this course of sums and commentaries is

that
