Book ΙΙ. OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING.

LE r this ground therefore be laid, that all works are ovcrcomc by am-
plitude of reward, by soundness of direction, and by the conjunfflon of la·-
bours. The first multiplieth endeavour, the second preventeth error, and

f the third supplieth the frailty of man; but the principal of these is direction:

For claudus in via antevertit curjsbrem extra viam. And Salomon excel-

ἢ lently scttcth it down, If the iron be not sharp, it requireth mare strength,
s but wiffdom is that which prevaileth ,· fignifying that the invention or e—
' lection of the mean, is more effestual than any inforcement or accumulation

of endeavours. This I am induccd to spcak, for that (not derogating from
the noble intention of any that have been deservers towards the state of

¹ learning) I do obscrve neverrthcss, that their works and asts are rather mat—

ters of magnific-enee and mcmory, than of progession and proficienee, and
tend rather to augment the mass of learning in the multitude of learned men,
than to reetify or raise the scicnccs themselves.

T HE works or asts of merit towards learning are conversant about three

’ obiests, the places of learning, the books of learning, and the persons of the

learned. Foras water, whether it be the dew of heaven, or the springs of
the earth, doth lcattcr and lose it self in the ground, except it be colleeted
into some receptacle, where it may by union comfort and sustain it self3 and
for that cause the industry of man hath made and framed spring-head8‚
conduits, cisterns and pools, which men have accustomed likewise to beautify
and adorn with accomplilhments of magnificence and state, as well as of use
and nccessity: So this excellent liquor of knowledge, whether it descend
from divine inspiration, or spring from human sense, would soon perish and
vanilh to oblivion, if it were not preserved in books, traditions‚ conferenceS,
and places appointed3 as univer-fines, eolleges and schools, for the reccipt
and comforting of the lame.

T Η E works which concern the scats and places of learning are four3 foun-
dations and building, endowments with revenues, enclowments with fran chises
and privileges, institutions and ordinances for government3 all tending to
quic-thess and privatcncss of life, and discharge of cares and troubles, much
lilte the stations which Virgil prescribeth for the living of bees 2

Principio sedes apibus statioque petenda,
Qto neque stt ventis aditus, &a
'fn Ε works touehing books are two ‚- first libraries, which arc as the ffirines
where all the relicks of the ancient saints, full of true virtue, and that without

delnsson or imposture, are preserved and reposed : sccondly, new editions of
authors, with more corre& impreffions, more faithful transsations, more pro-

. fitablc gloss'eS, more diligent annotations, and the like,

Tm: works pertaining to the persons of learned men (belides the advance—
ment and countenancing of them in general) are two : the reward and defig-
nation of readers in sciences already extant and invented ς and the reward
ancl designation of writers and enquirers, concerning 'any parts of learning,
not sufficiently laboured and prosecuted.

T Η ε s E are summarily the works and acts whercin the merits of many ex—
cellent princes, and other worthy personages have been conversant. As for
any particular commemoramus, 1 call to mind what Cicero said, when he
gave general thanks 3 ‘Dzfficile non aliquem, ingratum quenquam praeterire.
Let us rather, according to the scriptures, look unto the part of the racc which
is before us, than look back to that which is already attaincd.
