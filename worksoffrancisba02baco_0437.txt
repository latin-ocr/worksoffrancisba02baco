arc conversam: about youth. But how unjust this traduccment is (if you
will reduce things from popularity of opinion to measure of reason) may
appear in that wc see men are more Curious what they put into a new ves-
scl, than into a vess'el scasoncd; and what mould they lay about a young
plant, than about a plant corroborate5 so as the weakest ternis and times of
’ all things use to have the best applications and helpS. And will you hear-¹
ken to the Hebrew Rabbins? “ Your- young men shall fi’e vistons, and—your old
“ menfhall dream dreams? say they, youth is the worthier age, for that vi-
fions are nearcr apparitions of God than dreams. And let it be noted, that
howsoevcr the conditions of life of pedants hath been scorned upon theam-cs,
as the ape of tyranny5 and that the modern looseness or negligence hath ta-
ken no due regard to the choice of schoolmasters and tutors; yet the an-
cient wisdom of the best times did always make a just complaints that
states were too busy with their laws‚ and too negligent in point of educa-
tion3 which excellent part of ancient discipline hath been in some sort re-
vived of late times, by the colleges of the jesuits: of whom, although in re-
gat-d of their superstition I may say, 0⁶2⁷qu meliores, eo deteriore53 yet in re-
· gard of this, and some other pointS, concerning human learning and moral
matters, Imay say as Agtfilans said to his enemy Pharnabafus‚ Talis quum

sis, utinam noster (ff es. And thus much touching the discredits drawn from
the fortuncs of learned men.

As touching the manners of learned men, it is a thing personal and 111-
dividual: and no doubt there be amongst them, as in other profeffions, of
alltemperatures3 but yet so as it is not without truth, which is said, that
abeuntstudia in mores, studies have an influenec and operation upon the
manners of those that are conversant in them.

Bur upon an attentive and indifferent review, I, for my part, cannot find
:my disgtace to learning, can proceed from the manners of learned mem
not inherent to them as they ate learned3 except it be a fault, (which was
the supposed fault of Demosthenes, Cicero, Cato the second, Seneca, and
many more) that because the times they read of are commonly better than
the times they live ins and the duties taught, better than the duties praeiti-
sed. They contend sometimes too far, to bring things to perfection3 and
to reduce the corruption of manners, to honesty of precepts, or examples of
too great height3 and yet hereof they have caveats enough in their own
walks. For Solon, when he was asked whether he had given his citizens
the best laws, answered wisely3 “ Yea, of such as they would receive?
and ‘Plato finding that his own heart could not agree with the corrupt man-
ners of his country, refused to bear place or office3 saying, “ That a man's
“ country was to be used as his parents were, that is, with humble persuafions,
“ and not with contestations.” And Caesar's counsellor put in the same
caveat, Nou ad vetera instituta revocans quae jampridem corruptis moribus
ludibriosum: and Cicero noteth this error direetly in Cato the second, when
he writes to his friend Atticus ,- Cato optime fintit, fid nocet interdum reipub-
licae ,- loquitur enim tanquam in republica Platonis, non tanquam in faece
Romuli. And the same Cicero doth excuse and expound the philosophers
for going too far, and being too exa& in their prescripts, when he saith; -
Isti ipst praeceptores virtutis ὠ magistri videntur fines officiorum paulo
longius quam natura vellet protultffl’, ut cum ad ultimum animo contendi e-
mus, ibi tamen, ubi oportet, conststeremus: and yet himself mighthave said,

Illonitisgum minor ipfi’ meiss for 'it was his own fault, though not 111 so ex-
treme a egree.
