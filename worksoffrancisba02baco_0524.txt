and exemptcd from time, which are only our deeds and works 3 as it is said,
Opera eorum sbqnuntur eos. The preheminence likcwise of this aei ive good,
is upheld by the affection which is natural in man towards variety and pro-
ceeding, which in the pleasures of the sense, which is the principal part of
paffive‘cvood, can have no great latitude. Cogita quamdiu eadem seceris,
cibus, somnus, ludus per hunc circulum curritur, mori velle non tantum
fortis aut miser aut prudens, de etiamfastidt'ofits potest. But in enter·
prizeS, pursuits and purposes of life there is much variety, whereof rnen are
sensible with pleasure in their inceptions, progressionS, recoils, re-integtations,
approaches and attainings to their ends. So as it was well said, Vita fine
propostto languida ἐφ’ vaga est. N either harh this active good any identity
with the good of society, though in some case it hath an incidence into it :
for although it do many times bring forth aeis of beneficence, yet it is with
a respect private to a man's own power, glory, amplification‚ continuance ,ς
as appeareth plainly, when it findeth a contrary subject. For that gigantine
state of mind which possess'eth the troublers of the world, such as was Lucius
Sylla, and infinite other in smaller model, who would have all men happy
or unhappy as they were their friends or enemies, and would give form to
the world according to their own humours, (which is the true theomachy,)
pretendcth and aspircth to afflve good, though it recedeth farthest from good
of society, which we have determined to be the greater.

To resume passive good, it receiveth a subdivifion of conservative and
perfective. For let us take a brief review of that which we have said3 we
have spoken first of the good of society, the intention whereof embraceth
the form of human nature, whereof wc are mcmbers and portions, and not
our own proper and individualfor1n3 wc have spoken of aCtive good, and
supposed it as a part of private and particular good. And rightly, for there
is impress'ed upon all things a triple desire or appetite proceeding from love
to themselvess one of preserving and continuing their form3 another of
advancing and perfeeting their form3 and a third of multiplying and ex-
tending their form upon other things; whereof the multiplying or signature
of it upon other things, is that which we handled by the name of active
good. So as there remaineth the conserving of it, and perfecting or raifing
of it ς which later is the highest degree of passive good. For to preserve in
state is the less, to preserve with advancement is the greater. So in man,

Igneus cst ollis vzgor, <sy coelestis ongo.

His approach or assumption to divine or angelical nature, is the perfeffion
of his form ,- the error or false imitation of which good, is that which is the
tcmpest of human life, while man upon the instin& of an advancement for-
mal and ess'ential, is carried to seek an advancernent local. For as those which
are fick, and find no remedy, do tumble up and down and change place, as
if by a remove local they could obtain a remove internal ε so is it with men
in ambition‚ when failing of the means to exalt their nature, they are in a per-
petual estuation to exalt their place. So then pass'1ve good is, as was said,
either conservative or perfective.

To resume the good of conservation or comfort, which confisteth in the
fruition of that which is agrceablc to our natures; it seemeth to be the
most pure ancl natural of pleasures, but yet the softest and the lowest: And
this also receiveth a difference, which harh neither been well judged of,
nor well inquired. For the good of fruition or contentment‚ is placed ei-
