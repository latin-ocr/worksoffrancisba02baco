Book.11. 'OF LEARNING·.

light in anufio‘ns; but that 1 do much condemn that interpretation of the
seruitute, which is only after the manner as men use to interpret a prophane
boo .

IN this patr touching the exposition of the ici-iptureS‚ 1 can report no
deficience3 but by way of remembrance‚ this 1 will add, in perusing books
of divinity‚ I find many books of controversies‚ and many of common
places and treatises, a mass of positive divinity‚ as it is made an art3 a
number of sermons and lectures, and many prolix commentaries upon the
scriptures, with harmonies and concordances: But that form of writing in
divinity, which in my judgment is of all others most rich and precious, is
positive divinity collected upon particular texts of scriptures in brief ob·
servationis, not dilatcd into common plaees3 not chaling after controver-
fies, not reduced into method of art, a thing abounding in sermOnS‚ which
will vanissi, but defective in books which will remam, and 3 thing where-
inthis age excelleth. For lam persuaded, and Imay speak it, with an Ab·
fit invidia verbe, and no ways in derogation of antiquity‚ but as in a good
emulation between the vine and the olive, That if the choice and best of
those observations upon texts of scriptures which have been made disper-
sediy in sermons within this your majesty’s issand of Britain, by the space
of these sorry years and more, (leaving out the largeness of exhortations and
applications thereupon) had been set down in a continuance, it had been.
the best work in divinity‚ which had been written fince the apostles
times.

THE matter informcd by divinity is of two kinds3 matter of belief, and
truth of opinion; and matter of service and adoration; which is also indg—
ed and directed by the former; the one being as the interimi foul of reli-
gion, and the other as the external body thereof. And therefore the hea-
then religion was not only a worlhip ofidolS‚ but the whole religion was an
idol in it self‚ for it had no soul; that is, no certainty of belief or confes-
sion, as a man may well think, considering the chief doetors of their
churc'n were the poem, and the reason was, because the heathen gods were
no jealous gods, but were glad to be admitted into part„ as they had reason.
‘Neithet did they respe& the pureness of beart, so they might have external
honour and rites. ι

Bur out of these two do result and iss'ue four main branches of divini-
ty3 saith, manners, liturgy and government3 faith containeth the dochino
of the nature of God, of the attributes of God, and of the works of God:
the nature of God consisteth of three persons in unity of Godhead: the at-
tributes of God are either common to the Deity‚ or respective to the per—
sons; the works of God summary are tw0‚ that of the cremon, and that
of the redempti0n3 and both these works, as in total they appertain to the

unity of the Godhead, so in their parts they refer to the three persons:
That of the creation in the mass ot* the form to the Son, and in the conti-
nuance and conservation of the being to the Holy Spirit3 so that of the re—
dempdon, in the cleciion and counscl to the Father, in the whole a& and
consummation to the Son, and 'ni the application to the Holy Spirit3 for by
the Holy Ghost was Clartst conceived in fit-lh, and by the Holy (3110st are

the ele& regenerare in spirit. This work likewise we consider either cf-
fectually in t-he elect, or privately in the reprobate, or according to the ap-

pearance in the visible chureii.
