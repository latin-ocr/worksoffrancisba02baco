libertyto coin, and framc new ternis of art; to express their own sense, and
ro avoid circuit of speech, without regard to the pureness, pleasantnels,
and (as I may call it) lawfulness os the phrase or word. And again,
because the great labour then was with the people (os whom the l‘ha-
risees were wont to say, Exn-rabilis ista turba quae non novit legem ‚·) sor
the winning and persuading ofthem, there grew of necellity in chief price
and request, eloquence and variety of discourse, as the fittest and forciblest
aecess into the capacity of the vulgar sort5 so that these four causes coneur-
ring, the admiration ofancientauthors, the hate of the school—men, the exact
study of languagcs, and the efficacy of preaching, did bring in an affcctionate
study of eloquence, and copia of speech, which then began to fiourilh. This
grew speedily to an excess; for men began to hunt more after words than
matter-3 and more after the choiceness of the phrase, and the round and
clean composition of the sentence, and the sweet falling of the clauses, and
the varying and illustration of their works with tropes and figures, than'
after the weight of matter, worth of subjea, soundness of argument, life
ofinvention, or depth of judgment. Then grew the flowing and watry
vein of Osorl'ns the “Portugal bilhop to be in price. Then did sturmius
spend stich infinite and curions pains upon Cicero the orator, and [Jermoge-
nes the rhetorician, besides his own books of periods, and imitation, and
the like. Then did Car of Cambridge, and Ascloarn with their leffures and
writings, almost deify Cicero and Demosthenes, and allure all young men
that were studious unto that delicate and polilhed kind of learning. Then
did Erasinus take occasion to make the scoffing echo3 Decem annos con-
(itmpst in legendo Cicerone: and the echo answered in Greek, ”οε, Asine.
'Then grew the learning of the school-men to be utterly despised as barba-
rous. In sum, the whole inclination and bent of those times, was rather
towards copia than weighr.

HERE therefore is the first distemper of learning, when men study words
and not matter· whereof thone, h Ihave represented an example of late
times, yet it hath been, and will be secundnm majus ὅγ’ minus in all time
And how is it poshble but this should have an operation to discredit
learning, even with vulgar capacitieS, when they see learned mens works
like the first letter of a patent, or limned book3 which though it hatha
large flouriffies, yet it is but a letter? It seems to me that Pygmalion's
frenzy is a good emblem or portraiture of this vanity: for words are
but the images of matter, and except they have life of reason and inven-
tion, to fall in love with them, is allone as to fallin love witha pisture

ΒΗΤ yet notwithstanding it is a thing not hastily robe condemned, to
cloath and adorn the obscurity, even of philosophy it self, with sensible
and plausible elocution. For hereof we have great examples in Xenophon,
Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, and of ‘Plato alsoin some degree3 and hei-eof like-
wise there is great use: for surely, to the severe inquisition of truth, and
the deep progress into philosophy, it is some hindrance3 because it is too
early satisfae‘tory to the mind of man and quencheth the desire of farther
search, before we come to a just period. But then if a man be to have any
«use of such knowledge in civil occasions, of conference, counseI, persua·
fion, discourse, or thelike: then shall we find it prepared to his hands in
those authors which write in that manner. But the excess ofthis is so just·
ly contemptible, tharas Hercules, when he saw the image of Adonis, Venus
minion, in a temple, said in disdain, Nilsc'zcri es3 so there is none of
Hercules' followers in learning, that is, the more severe and laborious sort of
