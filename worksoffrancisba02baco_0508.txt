wreck, and had pald their vows to Neptune, saymg3 ‘⁵ Advise now, you
“ that think it folly to invocate Neptune in tempcl't: yea, but [luith Diago—
“ ras) where are they painted that are drowncdr' Let us behold itin an>
other instance, namely‚ “ That thc spirit of man, being osan equal and
“ uniform substance, doth usually suppose and feign in nature a greater c—
“ quality and uniformity, than is in trurh.'' Hence it conteth, that the
mathematicians cannot ilitisfy themselves, except they reduce the motions
ofthe celestial bodies to perse& circles, rejecting spir-al lines, and labouring
to be discharged of eccentriekS. Hence it cometh, that whereas there are
many things ih nature, as it were monadica, sin Jurls ‚- yet the cogitations of
man do feign unto them relatives, parallels and conjugares, whereas no such
thing is, as they have seigned an clement of tire to keep square with earth,
water and air, and the like; nay, it is not eredible till it be opened, whata
number of fiffions and fantafies, the similitude of human afflons and artsf,
together with the making of man communis mensura, have brought into na⁴
tural philosophy, not much better than the heresy ofthe Anthropemorphites
bred in the cells of gross and solitary monks, and the opinion of Epicurus,
answerable to the same in heathcnifin, who supposed the gods to be ofhu-
man shape. And therefore Velleius the Epicurean neederh not to have ask-
en, Why God should have adorned the heavens with stars, as if he had been
an AEdil253 one that should have set forth some magnificent ssiews 01· plays.
For if that great work-master had been of an human disposition, he would
have east the stars into some pleasant and beautiful works and orders, like
the frets in the roofs of houses; whereas one ean scarce find a posture in
square, or triangle‚ or straight line amongst such an infinite number3 so
differing an harmony there is between the spirit of man, and the spirit of
nature. ·

LET us consider again, the false appearanees imposed upon us by every
man's own individual nature and custom in that feigned suppofition that
Plato maketh of the cave3 for certainly, if a child were continued iu a grot
or cave under the earth until irmturity of age, and came suddenly abtoad,
he would have strange and absurd imaginations. So in like manner, al-
though our persons live in the view ot* heaven, yet out spirits are included
in the caves of our own complexions and customs, which minister unto us
infinite errors and vain opinions, ifthey bc not recalled to examination. But
hereos we have given many examples in one of the errors, or peccant hu-
mourS, which we ran briefly over in our first book.

AND lastly, let us confidet the false appearances that are imposed upon
us by words, which are framed and applied according to the eonceit
and capacities of the vulgar sort3 and although we think we govern our
words, and prescribe it well, Loquendum ut vulgus, sentiendum ut fhpientes ς
yet certain it is, that words as a Tartar's bow, do lhoot back upon the un—
derstanding of the wiscst‚ and mightily entangle and petvert the judg-
ment3 so as it is almost nccess'ary in all controverfies and disputations, to
imitate the wisdom of the mathematicks‚ in setting down in the very begin-
ning the definitions of our very words and terms‚ that others may know
how we accept and understand them, and whether they concur with us
or no. For it cometh to pass for want of this, that we are sure to end.
there where we ought to have begun, which is in questions and differen-
ces about words. To conclude therefore, it must· be confeffed that it is
not possible to divorce ourselves from these fallacics and false appearan-
ecs‚ because they are inseparable from our nature and condition of lists33
