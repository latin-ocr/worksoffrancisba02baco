mixture with pride> in the 116311, and eoncupisccnee or sensualiry 1111116·
livcr, deserveth not to be despised, but much 1613 10 116 allowed. So then
we have constituted (as in our own wilh aud advice) the inquiry touch-
ing human nature entire, as a just portion of knowledge to be hand-led
apart. - >

THE knowledge that conccrncth man's body, 13 divided 33 1116 good of
man’s body is divided, unto which it referrcth. The good of man's body
is of four kinds, health, beauty, strength and pleasure: So the knowledgess
are medicine, or art of curc5 311 of decoration, whichis called colinetick;
311 of affixity, which is called athletick5 and art voluptuary, which Taci-
tus truly calleth E rudit-us luxus. This subject of man’s body, is of 311 other
11111133111 nature most susceptible of remedy3 but 111611 that remedy is most*
suseeptible of error. For the same subtility of the subject doth cause large
possibility, and easy failing; and therefore the inquiry ought to 116 the more
exast.

To speak therefore of medicine, and to resume that we have said, as2
cending a little higher3 the ancient opinion that man was microcosmus, an
abstrait or model of the world, hath been fantastically strained by Paracel-
fiaes and the alchymistS, as if there were to be found in man's body certain
correspondenees and parallels, which should have respect to all varieties of
things, asstarS, planetS, minerals, which are extant 111 the great world. But
thus much is evidently true, that of all fubstances which nature harh pro-
duced, man’s body is the most extremely compounded: For we see herbs
and plants 316 nourished by earth and water3 beasts for the most part by
hei-bs and fruit53 man by the flesh of beasts, birds, fishes, herbs, grains,
1111113, water, and the manifold alterations, dreffings, and preparations of
these several bodies, before they come to be his food and aliment. Adel
hereunto, that beasts have a more simple 'order of life, and less change
of affections to work upon their bodie83 whereas man in his mansion,
ssecp, exercise, pafiions, hath infinite variations÷ and it cannot be denied5
but that the body of man of all other things is of the most eompoundecl
mass. The foul on the other side is the simplest of all ’[111111311663, as is well
express'ed:

Parumque reliquit
AEthereumftnfitnt, atque aurai'stmplicis Ignem.

So that it is no marvel, though the foul so placed enjoy 110 rest, if that prin- ·
ciple be true, that Motus rerum est rapidus extra locum, placidus in loco.
But to the purpose: this variable composition of man's body 113111 made it
as an instrument easy to distemper‚ and therefore the poets did well to con-
join musici< and medicine in Apelle, because the office of medicine is but to
tune this curious harp of man's body, and to reduce it to harmony. So·-
thcn the [11111661 being so variable, hath made the art by consequence more
conju-”tumn and art being· conjestural, hath made [0 11111611 1116 more place ⁴
to be left for imposture. For almost all other arts and seiences 316 judged
by 3613 01 master-picccs, as I may term them, and not by'the successes and
events. The lawyer is judgcd by the virtue of his pleading, and not by the ·
issue of the cause. The master in the ship is j udged by the directing his course ν
might, and not by the fortune of the voyage. But the physicum, and pet-
haps the politiciau, hath no particular 3613 demonstrative of his ability‚ vbut -
