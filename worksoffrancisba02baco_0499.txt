Bookn. OF LEARNING

Fon arts- of pleasure sensual, the chief deficicnce in them is of laws to
repress them. For as it harh been wcll observcd, that the arts which flou-
rilh in times while virtue is in growth are military, and while 'virtue is in
state are liberal, and while virtue is in declination are voluptuary3 so 1
doubt, that this age of the world is somewhat upon the descent of the
wheel. With arts voluptuary I conple practices jocum-3 for the dcceiving
of the senses is one of the pleasurcs of the senseS. As for gamcs of recrea-
tion, 1 hold them to belong to civil life and education. And thus much
of that particular human philosophy which concerns the body, which is but
the tabernaclc of the mind.

Fon human knowledge which concerns 'the mind, it hath two parts,
the one that inquireth of the substance or nature of the foul or niind5 the⁴
other that inquireth of the faculties or funffions thereof: Unto the first of
these, the considerations of the original of the foul, whether it be native or
adventivc‚ and how far it is exemptcd from laws of matter, and of the im-
mortality there0f3 and many other points do appertain‚ which have been
not more laborioussy inquired, than varioussy reported; so as the travail
therein taken, scemerh to have been rather in a mazc than in a way. But
although 1 am of opinion, that this knowledge may be more really and
soundly inquired even in nature than it harh been3 yet Ihold‚ that in the
end it must be bounded by religion, or else it will be subject to deecit and
delufion: for as the substance of the soul in the creation was not extracted
out of the mass of heaven and earth, by the benedietion of a producat, but
was immediately inspired from God; so it is not possible that it should be
(otherwise than by accident) subice} to the laws of heaven and earth, which
are the subject of philosophy3 and therefore the truc knowledge ofthe na-
ture, and state of the foul, must come by the fame inspiration that gave the
substance. Unto this part of knowledge tonehing the soul there be two'
appendixes, which as they have been handled, have rather vapoured forth
fablcs than kindled truth‚ divination and fineination.

DIVINATION harh been anciently and fitly divided into artificial and na-
tura13 whereof artificial is, when the mind maketh a predistion by argu-
ment, concluding upon figns ancl tokens: natural is, when the mind hath a
presentation by an eternal power, without the inducemcnt of a fign. Ar-
tificial is of two forts, either when the argumentis coupled with a deriva-
tion of causes which is rational, or when it is only grounded upon a co-
incidence of the effe& which is experimental‚ whereof the latter for the
most part is superstitious: such as were the heathen observations upon the
inspection of sacrifices, the ffights of birds, the swarming of bees, and such
as was the Chaldean astrology, and the like. For artifieial divinationi, the
several kinds thereos are distribntcd amongst particular knowledge& The
astronomer harh his prediCtionS‚ as of conjunctions, aspests, eclipse5‚ and
the like. The physteian harh his pretiiffioiis, of death, of recmery, of the
accidents and iffues of diseases. The politician harh his predifflons3 Ο ,urbem
vaenalem, (ἐν cito perituram, st emptorem invenerit .‘ which flayed nor long to
be performed in Sylla first, and after in Caefizm so as these predie'tions are
now impertinent, aqi to be referred over. But the divination xx liieh spring·
eth from the interna? nature of the foul, is that which we now l'peak of,
which harh been made to be oftwo l'orts, primitive and by influxion. Pri·
mitive is grounded upon the supposition, that the mind when it is with-
drawn aud collcelcd int«) it sslf ‚ind not diffustd into the Ol'ngIS of the

body,
