OF THE ADVANCEMENT Bookl.

To proceed now from imperial and military virtue, to mom} aud private
''virtuez first, it is an ass'urcd tuith, which is contained in the verses ς

Scilicet ingenuas didicisse fideliter arte-s,
Emollit mores, nec sinit fffe seros.

it taketh away the wildness‚ and barbarism, and fiercencls of mens mintha
but indeed the accent had need be upon fideliter .· for a little iupcrlicial
learning doth rather work a contrary effect. lt takcth away all lexhy, te‘-
merity, and insolency, by copious suggestion os all doubts ancl dii'sicultieS,
ancl acquainting the mind to balance reasons on both fides, and to turn
back the first offers and conceits of the mind, and to accept os nothing
but examined and tried. It taketh away vain admiration osany thing, which
is the root of all weakness : For all things are admired, either because they
are new, or because they are great. For novelty, no man that wadcth in
learning or contemplation throughly‚ but will find that printed in his heart,
Nil novi Ji'iper terram. Neither can any man marvel at the play of pup-
pets that goeth behind the curtain, and adviseth well of the motion. And
for magnitude, as Alexander the Great, after that he was used to great
armies, and the great conquests of the spacious provinces in Asta, when he
received letters out of Greece, of some lights and services there, which were
commonly for a passage or a fort, or some walled town at the most, he said,
“ It seemed to him, that he was advertised of the battels of the frogs and.
.“ the mice that the old tales went of.''

So certainly, if a man meditate upon the universal fmme of nature, the
earth with men upon it, (the divineness of souls excepted) will not seem much
other than an ant-hill, whereas some ants carry corn, and some carry their
young3 and some go empty, and all to and fro a little heap of dust. It
taketh away or mitigateth fear of death, or adverse sor-tunes which is one
of the greatest impediments of virtue, and imper-feciions of manners. For
if a man’s mind be deeply seasoned with the consideration of the mortality
and corruptible nature of things, he will easily concur with E pateras, who
went forth one day, and saw a woman weeping for her pitcher of earth that
was broken ,- and went forth the next day, and saw a woman weeping for
her son that was dead5 and thereupon said, Heri vidi fragilem frangi,
hodie vidi mortalem mori. And therefore Virgil did excellently and pro-
foundly couple the knowledge of causeS, and the conquests of all fears
together, as concomitantia:

Felix qui potuit rerum cognoftere caustis,-
Qique metus omnes, &a inexorabile fatum
Suojecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.

,ῘΤ were too long to go over the particular remedies which learning doth'
minister to all the diseases of the mind, sometimes purging the ill humours,
sometimes opening the obstrustffins, sometimes helping digestion, sometimes
mereafing appetite, sometimes healing the wound and exulcerations thereos}
and the likes and therefore I will conclude with that which harh ratio-
nem tohu-⁸⁴> Which is, that it disposeth the constitution of the mind not to
be fixcd or settled in the dcfests thereos, but still to be capable and. suscep-
flble of growth and reformation. For the unlearned man knows not what
¹t 15 to descend into himself, or to call himself to account ,- nor the pleasure

of that fiiaviſjima vita, indies fintirest’fieri meliorem. The good paris 1er
