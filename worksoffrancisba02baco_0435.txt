Bookl. OF LEARNING.

by ‘Demqsthenes toliis adversary AEsbhines, that was a man given to pica*
sure, and told him, “ That his orations did smell of the lamp. lndeed (said
“ Demosthenes) there is a great differenee between the things that you and Ι do
“ by lamp-light.” So as no man need doubt, that learning will expulse bu-
finess, but rather it will keep and defend the poffeffion of the mind against
idleness and pleasure, which otherwise, at unawarCS, may enter to the pre—
judice of both.

A GA 1 N, fot that other conccit, that learning should under-mine the reve-
rence of laws and government, it is ass'uredly a mere depravation aud ea-
lumny, without all ssiadow of truth. For to say, that a blind cust-om os
obedience should be a surer obligation, than duty taught and understood: it
is to affirm, that a blind man may tread i'urer by a gulde, than a seeing man
can by a light. And it is without all controversy, that learning doth make
the mincis of men gentle, generous‚ mani-able, and pliant to government3
whereas ignorance makes thern churlisn, thwarting and mutinous: and the
evidence os time doth clear this ass'ertion, confidering that the most barba-
rous, rude and unlearned times have been most subject to tumults, seditions
and changes.

AND as to the judgment of Cato the censor, he was well puniihed for his
blasphemy against learning, in the same kind wherein he offended3 for
when he was past threescore years old, he was taken with an extreme de-v
fire to go to school again, and to learn the Greek tongue, to the end to per-
use the Greek aurhors3 which doth well demonstrate, that his former cen-
sure of the Grecian learning was rather an affeded gravity, than according
to the inward sense of his own opinion. And as for Virgil's verses, though
it pleased him to brave the world in taking to the Romans the art of em-
pire, and leaving to others the arts of subicit& yet so much is manifest,
that the Romans never aseended to that height of empire, 'till the time
they had aseended to the height of other arts. For in the time of the
two first Caesars, which had the art of government in greatest perfectiora,
there lived the best poet Virgilius Maro, the best historiographer Titus
Livius, the best antiquary Marcus Varro, and the best or second orator
Marcus Cicero, that to the memory of man are known. As for the ac-
cusation of Socrates, the time must be remember'd when it was prosecuteds
which was under the thirty tyrantS, the most base, bloody and envious
persons that have governed3 which revolution of state was no sooner over,
but Socrates, whom they had made a person criminal, was made a person
heroical, and his rnemory accumulate with honours divine and human:
and those discourses of his which were then termed corrupting of manners,
were after acknowledged for sovereign medicines of the mind and manners,
and so have been received ever fince till this day. Let this therefore serve
for answer to politieianS, whichin theirhumorous severity, or in their feigned
gravity have presumed to throw imputations upon learning3 which redargu-
tion neverthelcss (save that we know not whether our labours may extend
to other ages) were not needful for the present, in regard of the love and
rcverence towards learning, which the example and countenance of two
so learned prineeS, queen Elizabeth, and your majesty3 being as Castor
and Pollux, Lucida Sidera, stars of excellent light, and most benign in-
fluence, harh wrought in all men of place and authority in our nation.

N ow therefore we come to that third sort of discredit, or diminution of
credit, that groweth unto learning from learned men themselves, which
commonly cleaveth fastest3 it is either from their fortune, or 'from their
mannerS, or from the nature of their studies. For the first, it is not in their
