ssookl. OF LEARNING.

some after supper, for entertainmcnt sake, that Callisthenes, who was an
eloquent man, might spcak of some theme or purpose at his own choicc,
which Callgslhenes did ‚- chufing the prail'e of the Macedonian nation for his
discourse, and performing the lame with so good manner, as the hearers were
much ravished ε whereupon Alexander, nothing plcal'cd, said, ⁸⁴ lt wa:
“ caly to be eloquent upon so good a subjcsts' But, saith he, “ Turn vom·
“ style, and let us hear what you ean say against us :'' which Callzstrfems
presently undertook, and did it with that sting and life, that Alexander in-
ter-rupted him, :md said, “ The goodncss of the vcause made him eloquent·
“ before, and despight made him eloquent then again.''

C oN s 1 D ER farther‚ for tropes of rhetorick, that excellent use ofa me·
taphor or transsation wherewith he taxed Antipater, who was an imperiou's
and tyrannous governor ε for when one of Anttpater's friends commended
him to Alexander for his moderation, that he did not degenerate as liis o-
therlieutenants did into the ‘Perfian pride in use of purple, but kept the
ancient habit of Macedon, of black ε “ True (saith Alexander) but Anti-
“ pater is all purple within.'' Or that other, when Parmenio came to him
, in the plain ofArbela, and shewed him the innumerable multitude of hi‘s
enemies‚ especially as they appeared by the infinite number of lights, as
it had been a new firmament of stars, and thereupon advised him to affail
them by night: whereupon he answered, “ That he would not steal the
“ viCtory.'' v

Fon matter of pohey, weigh that fignificant distinCtion so much in all
ages embraced, that he made between his two friends Hephaestion and Cra‘-
teras, when he said, “ That the one loved Alexander, and the other loved
“ the king :'' describing the principal difference of princes best servants,
that some in affection love their person, and others in duty love their
ctown.

WE1 G‘H also that excellent taxation of an 'error ordinary with counsel-
lors of princeS, that they counsel their masters according to the model of
their own mind and fortune, and not of their masters: When upon ‘Da-
rius’s great offers, Parmenio had said, ‘⁶ Surely I would accept these offers,
“ were I as Alexander;” saith Alexander, “ So would I, were I as
“ Parmenio?

LASTLY, weigh that quiclt and acute reply, which he made when he'
gave so large gifts to his friends and servants, an'd was asked what he did
reserve for himself, and he answered, Hope: Weigh, as I say, whether he'
had not cast up his account right, because hope must be 'the portion of all
that resolve upon great enterprizes. For this was Ca'efitr’s portion when he
went first into Gaul, his estate being then utterly overthrown with largeffes.
And this was likewise the portion of that noble prinee, howsoever' transport-
ed with ambition‚ Henry duke of Guise, of whom it was usually said, that
he was the greatest usurer in France, because he had turned all his estate into
obligations. s
⁷ To conclude therefore, as certain criticks are used to say hyperbolically 5
“ That if all sentences were lost, they might be found in Vzrgil :'' So cer·
tainly this may be said truly, there are the prints and footsteps of all learning
in those few speeches‚ which are reported of this prince ε The admiration
'Qf whom, when Iconficler him not as Alexander the Great, but as Aristotle's
scholar, hath carried me too far.
