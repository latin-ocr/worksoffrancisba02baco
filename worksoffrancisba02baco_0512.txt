OF· THE ADVANCEMENT BbOkng.

IN the enumeration of these private and retired arts, it may be ‘thought 1
scek to make a great muster-roll of seienceS, naming them for lhew and osten—

tation, and to little other purpose. But let those which are skilful in them

judae, whether I bring them in only foi· appearance, or whether in that which
1 spec-ak of them, (though in few words) there be not some seed of proficiences
And this must be remember’d, that as there be many of great account in
their countries and provinces, which whenth‘ey come up to the seat of the
estate, arc but of mean rank', and scarcely regarded: So -thesc arts being
here placed with the principal and supreme sciences, seem petty thing83 ‚yet
to such as have chosen them to spend their-labours and studies in them, they
seem great matters. ς ς

F on the method of tradition, Isee it bath movcd a controversy in our
time. But as in civil bufiness, if there be a meeting, and men fall at words,
there is commonly an end of the matter for that time, and no proceeding at
all: so in learning, where there is much controversy, there is many times
little inquiry. For this part of knowledge of method seemeth to me so wcak·
ly inquired‚ as 1 {hall report it deficient. ¹
’ ΜΕΤΗοι) hath been placed, and that not amiss, in logick, as a part of
judgment3 for as the doctri-'me of syllogisms comprehendeth the rules of
judgment upon that which is invented, so the doctrine of method containeth
the rules of judgmcnt upon that which is to be delivered3 for judgnicnt pre·
cedeth delivery, as it followeth invention. Neither is the method or the
nature of the tradition material only to the use of knowledge, but likewise
to the progression of knowledge: foi· fince the labour and life of one man
cannot attain to perfeci-ion of knowledge, the wisdom of the tradition is that
which inspireth the felicity of continuance and proceeding. And therefore
the most real diverfity of method, is of method referred to use, and method
referred to progression, whereof the one may be termed magistral, and the o-
ther of probation.

T HE later whereof seemeth to be via desbrta όν interdu a. For as know-
ledges are now delivered, there is a kind of contrait of error, between the de-
liverer and the receiver3 for he that delivered knowledge, defircth to deliver
it in such form as may be best believed, and not as may be best examined t
and he that receiveth knowledge, defircth rather present satisfaction than ex-
Pce'tant inquiry3 and so rather not to doubt, than not to err 3 glory making
the author not to lay open his wcakncss, and ssoth making the disciple not to·
know his strength.

Β U T knowledge, that is delivered as a thread to be spun on, ought to be
delivered and intimated, if it were possible, in the same method wherein it
was invented, and so is it poffible of knowledge induced. But in this same
'anticipated and prevented knowledge, no man knoweth how he came to
the knowledge which he hath obtained. But yet nevcrtheless, st’cundum
majus ὠ minus, a man may revisit and descend unto the foundations of his
knowledge and consent; and so transplant it into another, as it grew in 'his
own mind. For it is in knowledges, as it is in plants, if you mean to use

, the plant, it is no matter for the roots; but if you mean to remove it to

grow, then it is more affured to rest upon roots than ssips : So the delivery
of knowledgcs (as it is now usqd) is as of fair bodies of trees without
