oF THE ADVANC‘EMENT Bookt.

and no ear given to him, he fell down at his feets whercupon {Dionifiux
stay’d, and gave him the hearing, and granted its and afterward some—per—
son, render on the behalf of philosophy, reproved Aristippus, that lie would
offer the profcfli0n of philosophy such an indignity, as for a private suit to
fallat a tyrant’s feet. But 116 aiiswered: “ It was not his fault, but it was
“ the fault of (Βίου-φήμῃ that 116 had his ears in his fcet.’' Neither was it
accounted weakness, biit discretion in him that would not dispute his best
with Adrianus Caefizm excusing himself, “ That it was reason to yield
“ to him that commanded thirty legions.⁷' These and the like applica-
tioiiS, and stoopiiig 10 points of neccssity and convenience, cannot be dis-
allowed: for though they may have some outwai·d baseness, yet in a judg-
nient truly made, they are to be accouiited submiss'ions to the oecafion, and
not to the person.

Now I proeced to those errors and vanities which have intervencd a-
mongst the studies themselves of the learned, which is that which is prin-
cipal and proper to the present argument3 wherein my purpose is not to make
a justification of the errors, but, by a censure and separation of the errors,
to make a justification of that which is good and found, and to delivci· that
from the aspersion of the other. For we see, that it is the manner of men
to scandalize and dcprave that which retaineth the state and virtue, by ta-
king advantage upon that which is corrupt and degeneratc3 as the hea-
thcns in the primitive church used to blemish and taint the Christians, with
the faults and corruptions of hereticks. But nevertheless I have no mean·
ing at this time to make any exa& aniniadverfion of the errors and impedi-
ments in matters of learning, which are more secret and remote from vul-
gar opinion, biit only to speak unto sucli as do fall under, or near unm, a
popular observation.

THERE be therefore chiefly three vanities in studicS, whereby learning
hath been most traduced. For those things we do esteem vain, which are
either false or frivolous, those which either have 110 truth, or 110 use: and
those persons wc esteem vain, which are either credulous or curious3 and
curiosity is either in matter or words: so that 111 reason, as well as in expe-
rience, there fall out to be these three distempers (as 1 may term them) of
learning: the first fantastical learning5 the second, contentious learning3
and the last delicate learning, vain imaginationS, vain altercations, and
vain affestions3 aud with the lastI will begin. Martin Luther condu&ed
(no doubt) by an higher providence, but in discourse of reason, finding
what a province he had undertaken against the bilhop of Rome, and the
degenerare traditions of the church, and finding his own solitude being no
ways aided by the opinions of his own time, was enforccd to :iwake all an·
tiquity, and to call former times to his succours, to make a party against
the present time. So that the ancient authors, both in divinity, and in
humanity, which had long time ssept in libraries, began generally to be
read and revolved. This by consequence did draw on a necessity of a more
exquisite travel in the languages original, wherein those authors did write:
for the better understanding of those authors, and the better advantage of
press'ing and applying their words. And thereos grew again, a delight in
their manner of style and phrase, and an admiration of ‘that kind of wri-
tiiig3 which was much fiirtliered and precipitated by the enmity and oppo-
fition, that the propounders of those primitive, but seeniing new, opinions
had against the school-mem who were generally of the contrary part3
:ind whose „writings were altogether in a differing style and form5 taking
