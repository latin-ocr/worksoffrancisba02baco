 

AGAINST THE LORD CHANCELLOR.

was decreed3 but I cannot say it was ended: forthere have been many
orders fince caused by fir Francis Inglef'eild's contempts ; and I do remem-
ber, that when Thelwall brought the‘money, he said that my lord would
be yet farther thankful if he could once get his quiet, to which spcechl
gave little regard.

To the eightecnth article of the charge, viz. in the cause of Mr. ‘Dunch
he received from Mt. Dunch 200 l.

I confess and declare, that it was delivered by Mt. Thelwall to Hatcher
my servant for me as 1 think some time after the decree5 ,but 1 cannot
preciscly inform my self of the time. ⁷

To the ninetecnth article of the charge, viz. in the cause between Rey-
nell and Peacocke, he received from Reynell 200 l. and a diamond ring
worth 500 or 600 l.

I confess and declare, that at my first coming to the scal, when 1 was
at Whitehall‚ my servant Hunt delivered me 200 l. from fir George Reynell
my near ally, to be bestowed upon furniture of my house3 adding far-
ther‚ that hc had received divers former favours from me, and this was as
I verily think before any suit begun: the ring was certainly received pen-
dente lite; and though it were at new year's tide, it was too great a value
fora new year's gift3 though asl take it, nothing near the value men-
tioned in the article.

To the twentieth article of the charge, viz. that he took of Peacocke
100 l. without interest, security‚ or time ofpayment.

Ι confess and declare, thatl received of ΜΓ. Peacocke 100 l. at ‘Dorftt-
bousb, at my first coming to the scal, as a present3 at which time no suit
was begun3 and at the summer afterI sent my then servant Lister to Mr.
Rolfe, my good friend and neighbour at St. Albam, to use his means with
Mr. Peacocke, (who was accounted a moneyed man) for the borrowing of
500 l. and after by my servant Hatcher for borrowing of 500 l. more,
which Mr. Rolfh procured3 and told mc at both times, it should be with-
out interest, script or note, and that 1 should take my own time for pay·
ment of it.

To the twenty first article of the charge, viz. in the cause between
Smithwicke and Wehe, he received from Smithwicke 200 l. which was
re aid:

p1 confess and declare, that my servant Hunt did upon his account, be-
ing my receiver of the fines upon original writs‚ charge himself with 200l.
formerly received of Smithwicke3 which after that 1 had understood the
nature of it, I ordered him to repay, and to defalke it out of his accounts.

To the two and twentieth article of the charge, viz. in the cause of fir
Henry Rufwell, he received money from Rufivelk but it is not certain
how much:

Iconfess and declare, thatI received money from my servant Hunt, as
from Mr. Ruswell‚ in a pursc; and whereas the sum in the article being
indefinite, 1 confess [it] to be 300 or 4001. and it was about some month
after the cause was decreed; in which decree 1 was assisted by two of
the judoes. -

Barker, the lord chancellor received from Barker 700 l,
