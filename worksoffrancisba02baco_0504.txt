OF THE ADVANCEMENT Booiei'l,

son, Qae affensttm parit, operis effoeta est ,- but t'ne fiibtilty of nature and.
operations will not be inchaincd in those bonds: for arguments confist of
propositions, and propositions of words, and words are but the current to-
kens or marks of popular notions of things; which notioris, if they lie gros.
ly and variably eolleetcd out of particulam, it ss not the laborious examina*—
tion either of consequences of arguments, or of the truth of propositions
that can ever corre& that error, being (as the phyfieians speak) in the first
digestion3 and therefore it was not without caule, that so many excellent
pliilosopliers became scepticks and aeademieks, and denicd any certainty of
knowledge or eomprehenlion, and held opinion, that the knowledge of man
extended only to appearanees and probabilities. It is true, that in Socrates*
it was supposed to be but a form of irony, Scientiam dgffimularzdo fimula'-
vit: for he used to disable his knowledge, to the end to enhanee his know—
ledge, like the humour of Tiberius in his beginningS, that would reign, but
woiild not acknowledge so much3 and in the later acadeniy, which Cicero
embraced3 this opinion also of Acatalepst'a (1 doubt) was not held sincerely:
for that all those which excelled in copy of speech, seem to have eliosen
that set} as that which was fittest to give glory to their eloquenee, and va-
tiable discourses3 being rather like progress'es of pleasure‚ than iourneys to·
an end. But assuredly many leattered in both academies, did hold it in
subtilty and integrity. But here was their chief error3 they charged the
deecit upon the senseS, which in my judgment (notwithstanding all their
cavillations) are very sufficient to certify and report truth, (though not al*
ways immediately, yet by comparison‚) by help os instrument, and by pross
dtieing and urging such things as are too subtil for the sense, to some effe&
‘comprehensible by the sense, and othei· like affistance. But they ought to
have charged the deecit upon the weakness· of the intellcetual powers, and
upon the manner of colleffing, and concluding upon the reports of the senses.
This Ispcak not to disable the mind of man, but to stir it up to scel< help:
for no man, be he never so cunning or praffised, can make a straight line
or perfect circle by steadiness of hand, which may be easily done by help ofv
a ruler or eompass‘ ·

Tuis part of invention eoneerning the invention of seienccs, I pur-
pose (if 6οἀι give me leave) hcreafter to prop0und‚ having digested it in-
to two parts; whereof the one I term experientia literam, and the o-
ther, interpretatio naturae: the former being but a degree and rudiment
of the later. But Ι will not dwell too long, nor speak too great upon a
promise.

THE invention of speech or argument is not properly an inventi0n3 for
to invent, is to discover that we know not, and not to rceover or resummon
that which we already know3 and the use of this invention is no other: but
out of the knowledge, whereof our mind is already poflel's'd, to draw forth
or call before us that which may be pertinent to the purpose, which we
take into our consideration. So asto speak truly‚ it is no invention, but
remembranee or suggestion, with an applicati0n3 which is the cause why
the schools do place it after judgment, as subsequent and not precedent.
N evertheless‚ because we do account it a ehase, as well of deer in an inclosed
pai-l<‚ as in a forest at large, ancl that it liath already obtained the name;
let it bc called invention, so as it be perceived and discet-ned3 that the scope

and end of this invention, is readiness and present use of our knowledge,
and not addition or amplification thereos. ·
